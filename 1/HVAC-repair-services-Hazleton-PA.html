<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
