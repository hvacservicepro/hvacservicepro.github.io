<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
