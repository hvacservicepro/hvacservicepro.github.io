<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product.
