<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
