<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
