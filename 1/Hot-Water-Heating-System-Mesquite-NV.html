Finally, after an extensive selection process, the space agency chose Dometic. We've had a lot of firsts throughout the years, but this customized job presented unique difficulties for our engineers," said a spokesperson for Dometic.

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
