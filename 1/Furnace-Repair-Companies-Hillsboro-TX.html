<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming common functions of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure motion. Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all recently constructed homes in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post predicted that green real estate will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
