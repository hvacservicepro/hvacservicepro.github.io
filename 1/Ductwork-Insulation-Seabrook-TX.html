<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
