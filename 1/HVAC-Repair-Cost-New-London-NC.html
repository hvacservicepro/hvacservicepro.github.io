<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
