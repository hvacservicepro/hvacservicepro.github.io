<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, furniture and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may see undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>

She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
