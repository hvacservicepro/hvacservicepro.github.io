<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in performance advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
