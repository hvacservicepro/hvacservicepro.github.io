<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
