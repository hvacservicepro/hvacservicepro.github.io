<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
