<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
