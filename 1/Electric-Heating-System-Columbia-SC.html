<p>All Points Heating provides house a/c, a/c installation, air conditioner maintenance that deliver reliable, proven performance at high efficiency. Combustion items from car exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, area heating units, fragrant candles, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not effectively vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items may lead to nose, throat, and eye irritation; fatigue; dizziness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
