Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family home installation business completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source units. The absence of moving parts suggests you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
