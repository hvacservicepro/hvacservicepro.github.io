<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Because it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate effects that are often incorrect for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, queasiness and fatigue. The effects of CO exposure can vary greatly from individual to individual depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
