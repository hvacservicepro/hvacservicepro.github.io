Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air).
