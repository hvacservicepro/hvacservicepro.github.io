<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
