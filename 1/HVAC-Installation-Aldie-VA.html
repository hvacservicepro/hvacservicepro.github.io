<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
