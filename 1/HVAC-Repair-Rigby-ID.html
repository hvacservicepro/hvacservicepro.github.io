<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
