<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
