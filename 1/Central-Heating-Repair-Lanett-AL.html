Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
