This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
