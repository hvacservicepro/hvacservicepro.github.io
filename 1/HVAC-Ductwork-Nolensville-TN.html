<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners need to look out to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps need to not be carried out up until these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and reduce its life. Too little and your ac system won't have the ability to cool your home correctly. These are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into consideration when shopping for a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating unit, you may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
