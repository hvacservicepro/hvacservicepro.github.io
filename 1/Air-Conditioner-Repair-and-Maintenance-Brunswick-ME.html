<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
