<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Lots of people are ending up being more concerned and aware about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt containing allergens and pollutants can cover the cooling ductwork with time. Periodically it needs to be removed to revitalize the quality and enhance of indoor air and enhance the cooling. Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans up the air ducts physically by getting rid of the particles from the air filter.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
