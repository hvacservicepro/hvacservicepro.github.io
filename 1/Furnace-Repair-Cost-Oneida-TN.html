<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>
