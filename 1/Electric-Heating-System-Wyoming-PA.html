<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
