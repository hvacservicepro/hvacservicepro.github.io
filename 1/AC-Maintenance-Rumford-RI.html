<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
