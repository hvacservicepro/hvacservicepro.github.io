<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Because heating and cooling work might also require setting up or repairing plumbing to provide oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor might likewise be needed to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a certified plumbing on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this type of work. When getting a price quote, make sure to ask not just if a company is accredited, but also what kind of license it holds.<p>
