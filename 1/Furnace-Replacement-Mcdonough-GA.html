<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in gathering info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
