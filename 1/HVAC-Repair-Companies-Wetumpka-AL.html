On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and discover you require to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating.

The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
