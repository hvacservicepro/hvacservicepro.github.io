<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and cure-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
