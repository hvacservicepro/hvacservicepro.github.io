<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
