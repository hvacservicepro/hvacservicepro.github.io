<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Storm Lake IA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning system prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
