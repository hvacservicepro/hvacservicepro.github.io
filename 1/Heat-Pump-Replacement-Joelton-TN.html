<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Joelton TN</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
