For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

Natural ventilation schemes can utilize really little energy, however care needs to be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or damp environments, keeping thermal comfort entirely by means of natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements.
