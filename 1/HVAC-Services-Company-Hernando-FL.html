<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
