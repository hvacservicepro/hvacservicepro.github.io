<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
