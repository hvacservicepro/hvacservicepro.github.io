<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Ridgefield Park NJ 07660</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are usually not very effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, however the majority of do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working, stability Energy was fast to react. They showed up the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heaters can heat your house. Honestly, our house heater is made complex, Rob and his team repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
