<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>I have actually been using Waychoff for about ten years. First, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are really educated and professional. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was clearly sensible.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
