<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health.
