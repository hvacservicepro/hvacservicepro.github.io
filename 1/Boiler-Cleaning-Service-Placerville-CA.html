<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Placerville CA</h3>
<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My spouse said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a long period of time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
