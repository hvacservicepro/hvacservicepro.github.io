My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel.

You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
