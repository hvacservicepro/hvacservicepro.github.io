<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the home from family pipes that is made with lead materials. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested, the only method to understand. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
