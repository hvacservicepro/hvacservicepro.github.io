<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioner, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c unit will not have the ability to cool your home properly. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
