<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Duncan Oklahoma</h3>
<p>The use of air filters can trap some of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a house.

Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot.
