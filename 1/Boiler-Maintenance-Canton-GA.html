<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
