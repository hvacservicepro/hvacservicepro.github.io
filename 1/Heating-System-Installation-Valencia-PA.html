<h3>AC Technician in Valencia Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

That said, property buyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
