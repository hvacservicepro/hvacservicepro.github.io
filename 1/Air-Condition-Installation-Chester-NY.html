<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Every private house and small company needs the services of skilled specialists trained in the installation, maintenance, and repair of cooling, refrigeration, and heating unit. The Residential HVAC Service Technician certificate opens many doors of opportunity for HGTC graduates. The self-motivated graduate from this program has the technical training to work as an installation expert, service technician, service manager, or sales representative throughout the country.

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
