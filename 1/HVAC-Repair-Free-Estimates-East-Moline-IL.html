Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
