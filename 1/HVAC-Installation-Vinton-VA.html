<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>New air conditioning unit normally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating suggests greater energy effectiveness and potentially lower energy costs. An excellent SEER ranking for you depends upon your home size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally permitted SEER rating is going to be far more energy efficient than your existing, old air conditioning unit. It's not always about selecting the model with the greatest SEER rating, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Shut off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>

<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
