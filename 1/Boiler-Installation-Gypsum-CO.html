A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same room, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
