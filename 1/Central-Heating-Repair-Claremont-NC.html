If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Just like determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of unit for your home likewise depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
