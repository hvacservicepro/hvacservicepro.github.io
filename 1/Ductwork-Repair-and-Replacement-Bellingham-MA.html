<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
