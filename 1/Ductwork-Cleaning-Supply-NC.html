<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
