<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
