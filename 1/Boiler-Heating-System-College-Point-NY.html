<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
