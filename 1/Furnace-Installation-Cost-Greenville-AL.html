<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo looks for more than simply extra revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it searches for companies that can broaden Pueblo's customer base or offer a new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed restricted pipes work for select clients. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its abilities, allowing a boosted value proposal for a broader set of customers.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only using the services of a certified contractor or a certified agent from an organisation or seller to do the installation.

Do it right from the beginning and hire a licensed person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
