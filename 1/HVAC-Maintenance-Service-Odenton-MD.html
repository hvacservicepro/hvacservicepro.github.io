<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
