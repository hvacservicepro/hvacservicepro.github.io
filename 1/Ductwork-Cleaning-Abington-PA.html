<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Abington PA 19001</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimum efficiency and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to rise. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your home. If the system is too small, it will have to work harder and may get too hot. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
