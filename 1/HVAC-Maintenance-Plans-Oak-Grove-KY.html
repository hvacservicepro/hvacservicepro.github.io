<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Oak Grove KY Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
