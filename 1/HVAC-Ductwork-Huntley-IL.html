<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without can be found in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
