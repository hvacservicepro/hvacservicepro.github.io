<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

You might associate that lemony or piney aroma with a clean kitchen area or clean synthetic scents in laundry products and air fresheners produce lots of different chemicals into the air. You will not discover their names on the item labels. Traditional laundry detergents, fabric conditioners, anti-static sheet, and air fresheners in solid, spray, and oil form might all produce such gasses.<p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to minimize levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a sensible variety of houseplants remove significant amounts of contaminants in homes and workplaces. Since excessively moist soil might promote the development of microorganisms which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants must not be over-watered.<p>
