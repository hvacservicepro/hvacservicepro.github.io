<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Lusby MD</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of replacing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
