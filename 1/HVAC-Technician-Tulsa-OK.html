<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
