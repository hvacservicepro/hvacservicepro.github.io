<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
