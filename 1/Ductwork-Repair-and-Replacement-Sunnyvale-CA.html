<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Sunnyvale CA 94087</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
