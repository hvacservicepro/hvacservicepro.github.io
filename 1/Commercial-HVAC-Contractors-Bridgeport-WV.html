<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are great that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

During the assessment on a really cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new home owner I have learned how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
