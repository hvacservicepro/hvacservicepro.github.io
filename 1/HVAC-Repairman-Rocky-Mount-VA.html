<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
