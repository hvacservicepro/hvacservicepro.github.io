<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Center TX</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We selected getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
