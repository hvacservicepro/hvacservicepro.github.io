<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust.

For example, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs.

<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen.

<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is sincere, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
