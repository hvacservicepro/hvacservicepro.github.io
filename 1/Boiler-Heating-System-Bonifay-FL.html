<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
