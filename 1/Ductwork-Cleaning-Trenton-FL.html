<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Trenton FL</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system prior to you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC units even in winter season. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
