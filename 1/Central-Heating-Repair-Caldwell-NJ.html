<p>Mentioning air, radiant heating systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because required air heating unit distribute air-borne pollutants throughout the home during operation, provoking a range of various negative results. Radiant heat systems don't flow air at all, which in fact improves your indoor air quality by limiting your exposure to high levels of air-borne contaminants.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the very same method as an automobile radiator or common home ac system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
