<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
