<p>It is especially essential to take as many of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or participating in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also select to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather authorizations.<p>
