<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.
