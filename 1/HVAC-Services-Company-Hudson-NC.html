The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
