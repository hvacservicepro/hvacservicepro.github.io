<h3>Direct Purchase HVAC Equipment at Windermere FL</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow.
