<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
