<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Sean was very handy. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
