<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
