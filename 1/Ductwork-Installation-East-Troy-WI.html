<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
