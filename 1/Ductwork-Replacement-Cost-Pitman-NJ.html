<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, the majority of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
