<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.
