<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, eye, and nose inflammation.
