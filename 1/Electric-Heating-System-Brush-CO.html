<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's probably your problem.
