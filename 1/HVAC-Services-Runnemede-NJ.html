<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
