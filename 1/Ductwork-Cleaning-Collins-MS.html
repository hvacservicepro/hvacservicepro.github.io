Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>For whole home installations, it's tough, if almost impossible, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing home, particularly a hydronic system.
