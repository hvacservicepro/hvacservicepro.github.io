<p>I am changing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's development doesn't necessarily equate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The heating, air and ventilation conditioning company tends to run hot and cold. When customers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief versus the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here, demand heats up throughout the summer and winter season.<p>
