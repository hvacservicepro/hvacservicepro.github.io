<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
