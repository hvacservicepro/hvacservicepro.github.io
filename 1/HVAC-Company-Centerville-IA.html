<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the go to. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was extremely delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
