<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
