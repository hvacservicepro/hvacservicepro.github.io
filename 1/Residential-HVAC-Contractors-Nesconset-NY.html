<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
