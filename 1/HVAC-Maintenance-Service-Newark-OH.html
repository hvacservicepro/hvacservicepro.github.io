<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
