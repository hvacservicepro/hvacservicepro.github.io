<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
