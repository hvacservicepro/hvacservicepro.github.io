<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Agawam Massachusetts</h3>
<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is frosty, the evaporator coil is probably frozen. Likewise, if the air conditioner smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>If you have a big home, a home with high ceilings, a house with numerous windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floors rather than the air may not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed. Homeowners would be well advised to carry out a house energy audit to assess where enhancements may be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These changes might actually add up and potentially reduce your perceived need for in-floor heating.<p>
