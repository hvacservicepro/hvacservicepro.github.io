<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>
