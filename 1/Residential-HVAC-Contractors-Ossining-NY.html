<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
