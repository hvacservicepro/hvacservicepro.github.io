<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really small particles of dust.

For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
