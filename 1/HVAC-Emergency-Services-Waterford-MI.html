<h3>Central Heating Systems in Waterford MI 48329</h3>
<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to examine scenario & decided to go with them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air going however likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from beginning to end were very professional, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered fantastic customer service at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
