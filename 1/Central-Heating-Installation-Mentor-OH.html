That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a couple of years ago.<p>

<h3>How To Soundproof a Central Heating System in Mentor OH</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
