For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside.
