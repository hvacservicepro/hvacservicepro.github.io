<p>Selecting the ideal size air conditioner is a vital part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why buying the right size a/c unit matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up squandering money and energy. And if it's too little, you will not get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
