<p>The installation was quick, expert and very well done. The installers were respectful and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge easily individuals who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are very good and do not miss out on information that develops a job effectively done. I very highly recommend the 2 gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>

Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might pick to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system if you do so.
