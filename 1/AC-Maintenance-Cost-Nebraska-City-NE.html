Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
