Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
