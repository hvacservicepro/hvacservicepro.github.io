<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on.

Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air.

Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics listed below might be appropriate.<p>
