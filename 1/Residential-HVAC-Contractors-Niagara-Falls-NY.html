Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking, home items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heaters.

<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to select products that will avoid indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are discussed here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood items. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
