<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
