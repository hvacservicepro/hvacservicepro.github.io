<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was kind of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved problems. I would advise this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time.
