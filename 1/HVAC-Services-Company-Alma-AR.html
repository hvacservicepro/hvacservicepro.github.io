<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
