<p>Immediate results may appear after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant impacts are typically short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is merely removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified.

<p>Numerous individuals are ending up being more conscious and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality.

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the rooms. Many contemporary warm water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
