<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Set up cost reflects the most common average set up cost across the USA for a 3 Lot system. Cost may vary in your area. Price ranges shall apply to Standard Installation to consist of basic products and service, which might differ by the kind of system or system element chosen. All rate ranges go through change based on the unique attributes of the home. Any modifications or changes to Basic Installation agreed upon by Buyer will be an additional cost as negotiated by Buyer and the independent Trane Convenience Expert including the cost of mechanical licenses that might be needed by local and state law. Price ranges do not include any taxes, now or hereafter enacted. Taxes will be added by your Trane Comfort Professional to the sales price to comply with federal and local tax law.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
