<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer.

<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was quick to respond. They showed up the next day and changed 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new heating systems can heat the house.

<p>Think about prospective results of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, specifically guidelines on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted.

While an area heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
