<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
