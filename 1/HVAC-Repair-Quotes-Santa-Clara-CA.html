<p>They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They satisfied my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pressing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big organisation in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
