<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
