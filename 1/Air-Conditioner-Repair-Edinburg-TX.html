Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
