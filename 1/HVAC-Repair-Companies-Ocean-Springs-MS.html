<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>

In warm or humid climates, keeping thermal comfort exclusively through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outside air when proper.<p>
