<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>The toxins listed in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health impacts pointed out. However, it is not necessarily real that the impacts noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed results could occur.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which normally includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products provide a risk only when they are managed in a way that produces dust including asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the capacity for significant illness.<p>
