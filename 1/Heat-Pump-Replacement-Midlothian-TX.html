<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may observe musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
