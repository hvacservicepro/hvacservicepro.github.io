A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
