<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace since it's the most typical heater in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
