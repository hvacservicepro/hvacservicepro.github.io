<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Chesterfield Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
