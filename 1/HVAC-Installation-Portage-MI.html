<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>The toxins listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health results discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the effects noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk with your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
