<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Location control includes moving the toxin source away from residents or even relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>For pollutants besides radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptoms or signs of bad ventilation and particular sources or toxins have actually been determined as possible reasons for indoor air quality issues. Testing for numerous pollutants can be expensive. Prior to monitoring your house for pollutants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals who have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial structures.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and often quality) of outside air that should be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
