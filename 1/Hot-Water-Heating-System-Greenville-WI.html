<p>A customized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat out of the room since its condenser coil releases heat outside.

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Greenville WI - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Ductless a/c is, naturally, suitable for houses without ducts, but is also a flexible solution for a variety of other circumstances. Instead of pushing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and flooring, ductless systems distribute air directly to specific spaces. Very cost-efficient, and energy-efficient, and supplying greater control over when and where the air enters your house, All Points Heating can assist you select the very best ductless a/c system for your requirements.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
