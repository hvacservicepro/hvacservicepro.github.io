<p>The primary reason house owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee. Any significant repairs must be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. However, some makers require routine maintenance as a regard to the service warranty.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
