<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
