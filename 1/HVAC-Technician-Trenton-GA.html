<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
