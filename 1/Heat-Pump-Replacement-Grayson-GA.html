Simply as with switches, someone may have switched off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a manage that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. If you have an old furnace or boiler, you might have a pilot burner.
