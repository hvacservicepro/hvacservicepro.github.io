<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
