<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Kenner Louisiana</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Selecting the ideal size central air conditioning system for your home is very crucial, as is choosing either a package system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which places the condenser outside the home and the fan and coil within. Proper placement is likewise vital to ensure uniform and proper cooling. The pros at All Points Heating ensure you make all the ideal choices for your house.<p>
