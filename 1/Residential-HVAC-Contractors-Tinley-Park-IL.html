<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide contracts.  The so called reliable companies swindle more people than the fly by night attire. I understand due to the fact that I tried to work for them. I quit due to the fact that 90% of them are crooks. They stroll in with or without a contract and start selling you things you do not need.

<p>The majority of people do not recognize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break with time.

This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the inspection on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision.
