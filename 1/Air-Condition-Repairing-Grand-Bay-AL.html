Incorrect change, typically suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you buy a new gas stove or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
