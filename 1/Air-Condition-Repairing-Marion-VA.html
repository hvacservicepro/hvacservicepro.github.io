PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>
