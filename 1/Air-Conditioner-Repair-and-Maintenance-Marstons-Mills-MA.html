<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>

While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
