Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
