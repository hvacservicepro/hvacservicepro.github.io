<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
