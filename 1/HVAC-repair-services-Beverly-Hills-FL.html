<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Beverly Hills FL</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the growth of biological impurities are wet or wet building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
