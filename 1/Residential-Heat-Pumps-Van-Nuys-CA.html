<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
