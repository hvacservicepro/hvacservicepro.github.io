<p>Buildings are developed or meant to respond actively to some of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surface areas to improve their efficiency, appearance, or longevity. In other cases, such changes subtly or even considerably modify buildings in manner ins which might be essential to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We might find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, particularly, a few of the approaches utilized by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to acquire a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time.

We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time.

Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
