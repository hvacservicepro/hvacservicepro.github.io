He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
