<p>Great Item! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
