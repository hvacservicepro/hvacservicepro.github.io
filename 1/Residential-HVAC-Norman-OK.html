<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Norman OK</h3>
<p>Healthcare facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to reduce infection threat and the humidity controlled to restrict client dehydration. Although temperatures are often in the comfort variety, some specialist procedures, such as open heart surgical treatment, require low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, fairly heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and process applications, the goal might be to not just control temperature, however also humidity, air quality, and air movement from area to area.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
