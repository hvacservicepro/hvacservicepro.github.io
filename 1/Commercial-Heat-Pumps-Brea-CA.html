<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
