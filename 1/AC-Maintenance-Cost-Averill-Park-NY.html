<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
