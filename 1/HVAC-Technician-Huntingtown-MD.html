<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
