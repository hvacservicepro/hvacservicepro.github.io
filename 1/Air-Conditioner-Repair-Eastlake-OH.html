<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was known how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioning conditioners are known for supporting warranties and uses a standard 10-year service warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER rating in energy efficiency would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to install. Trane products are often more expensive than other HVAC brand names, but as the old stating goes, You get what you pay for." Trane is thought about a premium brand that provides exceptional air conditioners, heatpump, and gas furnaces.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be better to change the entire system.<p>
