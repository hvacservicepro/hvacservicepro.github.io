<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts mentioned.

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
