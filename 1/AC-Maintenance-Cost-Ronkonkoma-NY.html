<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Ronkonkoma NY</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Since an ac system moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
