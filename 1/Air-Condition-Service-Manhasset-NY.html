<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Manhasset NY 11030</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation need to be avoided.<p>
