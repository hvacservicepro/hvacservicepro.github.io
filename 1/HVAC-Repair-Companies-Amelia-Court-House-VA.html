Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.
