<p>A primary factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an efficient, properly created and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by managing the amount of air that is contributed to the workplace atmosphere, the tidiness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its pollutants are either exhausted to the outdoors or re-circulated throughout the building.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really critical to keeping a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and sometimes quality) of outside air that ought to be continually provided in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
