<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Waipahu HI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We chose getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
