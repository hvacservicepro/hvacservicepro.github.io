<p>Geothermal heat pumps are very effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.
