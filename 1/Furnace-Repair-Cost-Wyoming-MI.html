<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be residing in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. There are numerous design techniques in use today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with similar concepts.
