<h3>Air Conditioner Repairing Service in Savoy IL 61874</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
