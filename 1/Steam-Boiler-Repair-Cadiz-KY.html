<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

Also, clean ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line?

While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
