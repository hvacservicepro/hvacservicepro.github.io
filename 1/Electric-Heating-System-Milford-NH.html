<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and usually short-term. Often the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.

<p>The main reason property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty, the cost may not be worthwhile. Any major repairs should be covered under the producer's guarantee. However, some producers require routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be wiser to change the entire system.<p>
