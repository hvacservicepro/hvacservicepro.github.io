<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
