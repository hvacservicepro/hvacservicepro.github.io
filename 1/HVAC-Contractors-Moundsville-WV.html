<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day.

For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
