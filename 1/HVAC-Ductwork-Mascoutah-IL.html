<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit.
