<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
