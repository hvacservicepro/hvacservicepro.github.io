<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers depend on the outdoors air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.<p>
