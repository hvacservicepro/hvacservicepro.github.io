<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
