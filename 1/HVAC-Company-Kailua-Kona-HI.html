<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board need to be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.
