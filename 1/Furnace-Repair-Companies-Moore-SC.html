<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
