<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
