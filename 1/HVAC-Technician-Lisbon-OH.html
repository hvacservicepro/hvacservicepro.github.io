Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are very important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
