<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you work with to install your central air system. In truth, you can even Do It Yourself, despite our strong suggestion not to do so. Expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to set up central air if you do take our recommendation. Additionally, cooling contractors might charge an extra $50 to $200 for extra materials and devices.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
