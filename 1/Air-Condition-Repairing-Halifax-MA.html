CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
