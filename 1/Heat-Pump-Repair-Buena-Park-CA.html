<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to preserve and understand.<p>
