<h3>Things to Look for When Selecting an Bedford PA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic duty clause" applies. This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that an employer must offer a safe and healthy  work environment. Therefore, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the company's duty.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
