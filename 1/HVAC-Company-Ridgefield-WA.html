<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Ridgefield WA 98642</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>These people have been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these men two times. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
