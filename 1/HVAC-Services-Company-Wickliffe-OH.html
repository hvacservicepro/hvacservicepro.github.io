Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
