<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
