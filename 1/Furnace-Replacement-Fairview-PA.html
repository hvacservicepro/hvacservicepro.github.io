<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode".

When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
