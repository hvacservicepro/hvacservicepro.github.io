A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
