<h3>Floor Heating System in North Vernon Indiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>As you normally need to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating system, you must consider the time it considers this to totally dry before the floor covering can be put in location - this is normally a day or two.

Their techs are professional and very knowledgeable. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was clearly reasonable.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have actually been finished, the last job is to test the system to make sure it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.
