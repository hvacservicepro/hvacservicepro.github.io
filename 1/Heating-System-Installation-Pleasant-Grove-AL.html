<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can result in an unsafe build-up and compromise your security. The technician will assess all of these aspects of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will try to find signs of rust, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of numerous) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system.
