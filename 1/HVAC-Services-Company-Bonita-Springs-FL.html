The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

These elements consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), problems managing temperature level, low or high humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air coming into the structure.
