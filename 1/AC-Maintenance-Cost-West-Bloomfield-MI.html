<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
