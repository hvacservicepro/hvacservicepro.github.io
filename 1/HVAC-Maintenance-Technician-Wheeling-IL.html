<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Wheeling IL 60090</h3>
<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine situation & decided to opt for them for the work.

<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
