<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Shorewood IL 60404</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
