<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Alexandria LA</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more extreme with lower outdoor temperatures, so heatpump are frequently installed in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
