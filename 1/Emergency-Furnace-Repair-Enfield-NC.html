<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
