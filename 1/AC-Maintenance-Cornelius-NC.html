<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
