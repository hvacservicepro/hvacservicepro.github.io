<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>A third way to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your home might not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To identify smells in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Safe and secure specific removed cable televisions to the flooring using little blobs of hot-melt glue. Carefully cut and get rid of the orange mesh to free the cable. Do this to work around sections, angles and obstacles where full-width mats will not fit. Do not overlap the cable. When the entire mat is fitted and installed, press it strongly into the tape and hot-melt glue any loose ends or humps in the mat. Perform a resistance test to look for damage.<p>
