<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and shorten its life. Too little and your air conditioning system will not have the ability to cool your home correctly. These are simply a few of the aspects that you need to consider when looking for a brand-new AC system. Each option can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
