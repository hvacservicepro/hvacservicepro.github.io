<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Cottonwood CA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
