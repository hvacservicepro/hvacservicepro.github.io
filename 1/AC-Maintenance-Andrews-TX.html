<p>Professional heating unit installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists advise following this standard guideline when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your house still warms to the best temperature level.

Only be worried if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must employ a professional to check and repair the unit.<p>
