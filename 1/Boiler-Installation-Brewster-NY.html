<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã A lot of furnaces have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnÃ¢ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonÃ¢ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. ItÃ¢ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
