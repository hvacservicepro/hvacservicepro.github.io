<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation.
