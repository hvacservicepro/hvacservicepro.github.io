<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
