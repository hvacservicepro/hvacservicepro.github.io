<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
