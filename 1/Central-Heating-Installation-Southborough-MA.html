<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
