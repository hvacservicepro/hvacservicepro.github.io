The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
