If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
