<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
