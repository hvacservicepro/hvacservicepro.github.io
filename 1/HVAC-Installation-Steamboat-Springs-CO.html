Some sources, such as developing materials, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release toxins basically continually. Other sources, related to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies launch pollutants intermittently.

Inadequate ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or put in such a method that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly situated outside air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
