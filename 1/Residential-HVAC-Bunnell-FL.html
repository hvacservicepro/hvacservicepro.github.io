To make sure the system you pick is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation price quote to figure out the exact type of heat and air conditioning system that's just right for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size system you currently have.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
