<p>Some health effects may appear quickly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are treatable and usually short-term. Often the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Soon after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may show up, be aggravated or worsened.<p>
