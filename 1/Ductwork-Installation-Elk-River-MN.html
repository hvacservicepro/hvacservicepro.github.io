<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of elements including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same).

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to keep and comprehend.<p>
