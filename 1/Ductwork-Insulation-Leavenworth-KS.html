<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens should look out to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures need to not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.
