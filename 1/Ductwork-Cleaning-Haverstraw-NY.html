The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy.
