<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW.

He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have actually met in a long time. If we wish to have options to ACME heating, we require to support the real people who are there for us. Please do.<p>

Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then change it ON.
