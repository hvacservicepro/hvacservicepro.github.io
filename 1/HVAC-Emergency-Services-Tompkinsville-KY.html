<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Tompkinsville KY</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need fairly little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be looked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed regularly to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water locations).

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
