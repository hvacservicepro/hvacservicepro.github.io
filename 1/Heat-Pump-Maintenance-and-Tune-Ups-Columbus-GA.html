<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure residents may be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the form of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning items, building and construction activities, furnishings and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
