<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness inside is related to a higher frequency of resident breathing issues.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunshine to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a available and trusted  source of energy.<p>
