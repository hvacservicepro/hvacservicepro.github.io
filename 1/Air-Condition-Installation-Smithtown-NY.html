And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
