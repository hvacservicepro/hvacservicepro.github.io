The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only using the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a company or seller to do the installation.
