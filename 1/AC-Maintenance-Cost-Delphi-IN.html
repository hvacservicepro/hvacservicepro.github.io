They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
