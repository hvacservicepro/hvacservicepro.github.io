<h3>Gas Heating in Mastic New York</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Even with the ideal unit and appropriate installation, there's always the opportunity that your furnace will malfunction.

You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the choices for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>
