<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
