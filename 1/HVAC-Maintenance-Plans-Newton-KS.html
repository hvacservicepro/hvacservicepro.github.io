<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, particularly if you live in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced routinely, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
