Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
