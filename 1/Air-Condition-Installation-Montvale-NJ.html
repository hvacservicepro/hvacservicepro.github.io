<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.
