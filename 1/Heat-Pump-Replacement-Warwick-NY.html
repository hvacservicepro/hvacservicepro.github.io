<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
