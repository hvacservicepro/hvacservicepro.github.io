<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
