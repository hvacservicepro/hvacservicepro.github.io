<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
