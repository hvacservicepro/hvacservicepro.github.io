<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean easily, especially if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air.
