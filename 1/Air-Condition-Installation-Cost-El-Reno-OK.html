<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
