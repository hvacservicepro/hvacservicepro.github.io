<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy.
