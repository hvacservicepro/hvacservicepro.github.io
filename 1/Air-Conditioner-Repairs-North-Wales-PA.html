<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
