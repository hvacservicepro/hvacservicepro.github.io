<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
