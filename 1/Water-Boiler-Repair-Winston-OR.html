<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Winston OR?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
