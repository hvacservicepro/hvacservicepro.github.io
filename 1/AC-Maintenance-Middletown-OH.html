<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based upon current scientific and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years.

Improperly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise generate air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
