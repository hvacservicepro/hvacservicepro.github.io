<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
