<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the tools or skills needed to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system regularly.<p>
