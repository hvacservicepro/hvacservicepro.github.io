<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
