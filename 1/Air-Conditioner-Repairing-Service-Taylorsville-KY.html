<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy efficient than designs made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older.

The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
