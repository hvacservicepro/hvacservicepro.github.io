<p>Oil heaters are usually not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not attain an effectiveness greater than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air.
