<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
