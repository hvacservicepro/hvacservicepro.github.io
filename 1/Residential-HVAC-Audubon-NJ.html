<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>

However, some manufacturers require regular maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
