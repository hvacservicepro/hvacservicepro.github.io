<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>A lot of respectable HVAC service technicians will provide free estimates with an in-person service call.

<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller sized wall-mounted units, ductless divides enable you to prevent the need for a complete duct system like a lot of other cooling systems require.
