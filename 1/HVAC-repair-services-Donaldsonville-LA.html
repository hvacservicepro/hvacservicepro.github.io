<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor-free gas that disrupts the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a series of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, nausea, and confusion, to tiredness in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease.
