<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal.
