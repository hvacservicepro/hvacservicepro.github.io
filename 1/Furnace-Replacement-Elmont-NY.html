<h3>Air Condition System in Elmont NY 11003</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
