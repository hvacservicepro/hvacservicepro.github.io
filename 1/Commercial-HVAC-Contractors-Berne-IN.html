<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
