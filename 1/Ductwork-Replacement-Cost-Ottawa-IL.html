<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. If your air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, merely including refrigerant is not an option. A skilled technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant.

<h3>HVAC Repair in Ottawa Illinois</h3>
<p>When central air conditioning service stops working during a heat spell, you may need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to appear, and you'll most likely pay at least several hundred for the repair. But if you're comfortable working around electrical power and want to spend about $50 on parts, you can probably repair your a/c service yourself in about two hours and save about $225 on parts markup and labor.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
