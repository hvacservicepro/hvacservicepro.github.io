<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>By piping coolant directly into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless divides permit you to avoid the requirement for a full duct system like most other cooling systems require. You will also enjoy a a lot more flexible system in regards to installation and cost. And since each indoor unit has its own thermostat, you can bid farewell to thermostat warfare when someone would choose it a little warmer in a various space.<p>
