<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
