These convection heating systems are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
