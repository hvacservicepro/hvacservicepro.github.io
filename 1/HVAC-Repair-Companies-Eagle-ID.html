<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
