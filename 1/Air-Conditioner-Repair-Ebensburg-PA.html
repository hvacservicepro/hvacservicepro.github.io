<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not.
