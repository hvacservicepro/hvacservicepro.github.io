<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants.
