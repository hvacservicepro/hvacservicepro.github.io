<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the ideal temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Just be worried if your home is not heating up.
