<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
