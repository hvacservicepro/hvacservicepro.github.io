<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
