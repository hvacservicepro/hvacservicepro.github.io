<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
