<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every three months. During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.
