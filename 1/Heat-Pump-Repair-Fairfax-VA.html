<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
