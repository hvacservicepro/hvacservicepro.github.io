These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
