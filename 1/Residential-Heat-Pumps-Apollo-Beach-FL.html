<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
