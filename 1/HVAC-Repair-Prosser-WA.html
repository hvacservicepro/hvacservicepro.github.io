The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can differ significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job might need absolutely various steps and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected.

A little house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
