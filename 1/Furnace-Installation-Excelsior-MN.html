<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
