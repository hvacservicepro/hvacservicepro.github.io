<p>Specific instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to figure out if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is essential to pay attention to the time and location signs happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the area, for example, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness.
