<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance in Phillipsburg NJ 08865</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an a/c to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window.
