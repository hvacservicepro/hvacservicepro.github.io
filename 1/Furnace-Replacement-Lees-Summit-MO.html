<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
