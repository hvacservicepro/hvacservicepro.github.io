The present trend in home building is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
