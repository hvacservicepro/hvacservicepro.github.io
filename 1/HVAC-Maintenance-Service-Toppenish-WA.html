<p>Ac system can develop a great deal of water due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
