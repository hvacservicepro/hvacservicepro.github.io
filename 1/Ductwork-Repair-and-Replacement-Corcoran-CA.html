<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
