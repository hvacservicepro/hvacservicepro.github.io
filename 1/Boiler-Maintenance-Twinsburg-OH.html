<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software application. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>
