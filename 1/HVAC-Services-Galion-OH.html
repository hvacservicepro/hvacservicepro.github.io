They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they needed to purchase it. My spouse said that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have fulfilled in a very long time. We need to support the genuine people who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
