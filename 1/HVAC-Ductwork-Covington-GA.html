<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd issue that sometimes comes up. When you do see your furnace behaving strangely, it is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible. The faster you respond to issues with your furnace, the much easier they are to repair. Waiting to require repairs will just make the problem even worse, and frequently more costly.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building and construction (homes usually use in between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Covington GA</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as different as the different houses they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the kind of house HVAC system, appropriate air circulation (ventilation), proper filtration, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running securely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
