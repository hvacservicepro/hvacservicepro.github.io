<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater.
