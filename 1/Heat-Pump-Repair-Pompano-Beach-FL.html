<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards.

Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
