<p>I admit I have not done the math recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many people.<p>
