<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources may not posture a substantial health threat on their own, most houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to prevent new problems from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and unclean. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working effectively, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
