<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Hyde Park NY Home Owners</h3>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
