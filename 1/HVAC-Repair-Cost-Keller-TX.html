We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time.
