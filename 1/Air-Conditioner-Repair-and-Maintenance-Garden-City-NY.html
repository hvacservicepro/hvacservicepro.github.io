<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

Follow the producer's directions, specifically instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
