<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Lawrence Township NJ</h3>
<p>Among the main factors a furnace will run constantly is since something is blocked or unclean Prior to trying to repair any problem, take time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it if the air filter is good to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. Call an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
