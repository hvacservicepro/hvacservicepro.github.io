<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a few years earlier.<p>
