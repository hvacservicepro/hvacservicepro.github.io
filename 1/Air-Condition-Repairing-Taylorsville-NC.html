<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of products of incomplete combustion.

<p>Integrity Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heaters can heat your house. Truthfully, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his team repaired the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
