<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and kids are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Kids may have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
