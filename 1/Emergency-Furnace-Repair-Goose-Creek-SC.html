<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
