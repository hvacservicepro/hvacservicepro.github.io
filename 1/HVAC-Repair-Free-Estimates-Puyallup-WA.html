ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
