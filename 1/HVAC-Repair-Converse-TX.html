<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
