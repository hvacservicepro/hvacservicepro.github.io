<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>A/c unit makers typically make rugged, high quality items. Begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
