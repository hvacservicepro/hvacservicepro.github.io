<p>Typically the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
