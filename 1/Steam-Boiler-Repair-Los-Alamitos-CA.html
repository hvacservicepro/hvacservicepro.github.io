<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Everyone deal with a range of threats to our health as we go about our everyday lives.

If we had the opportunity to make informed choices, and some are risks we might choose to avoid. Indoor air pollution is one threat that you can do something about.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
