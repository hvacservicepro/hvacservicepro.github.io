Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic responsibility clause" applies.

<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is prudent to lower the use of chemical pesticides outdoors along with indoors. Depending upon the website and insect to be managed, one or more of the following actions can be reliable: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular cleaning of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by ensuring that wooden building materials do not enter into direct contact with the soil and by saving fire wood far from the home.
