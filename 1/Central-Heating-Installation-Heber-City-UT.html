<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being warmed.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator requires handled by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
