<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
