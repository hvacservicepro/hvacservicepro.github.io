<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It may likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
