<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.

Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
