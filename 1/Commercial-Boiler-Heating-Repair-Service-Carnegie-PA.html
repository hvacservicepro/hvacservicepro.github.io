<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit?

Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioner won't have the ability to cool the house appropriately. These are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into consideration when looking for a brand-new AC system.
