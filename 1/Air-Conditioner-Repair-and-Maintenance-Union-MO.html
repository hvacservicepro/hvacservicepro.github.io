<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
