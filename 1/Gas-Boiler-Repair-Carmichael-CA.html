My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Inappropriate adjustment, often suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you purchase a brand-new gas range or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns constantly. Never ever utilize a gas stove to heat your home. Constantly make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
