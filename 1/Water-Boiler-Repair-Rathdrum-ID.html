<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to purchase it. My other half said that she had seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called.
