<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.
