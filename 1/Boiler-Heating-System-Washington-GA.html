<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of products of incomplete combustion.
