<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
