<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>To begin, it's an excellent idea to think of energy efficiency. By choosing a central AC system that has as high of a performance score as possible, you can minimize your carbon footprint and conserve cash in the long run.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
