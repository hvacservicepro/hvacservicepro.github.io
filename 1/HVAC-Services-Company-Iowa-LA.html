<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. Sometimes it's not a significant problem, and your system may simply need some maintenance work.

<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the best temperature.

Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to contact an expert to inspect and repair the unit.<p>
