<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair at Syracuse NY</h3>

After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
