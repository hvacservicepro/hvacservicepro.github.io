<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many people assume contamination is just an outdoor issue, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we don't think sufficient about exposure to all the important things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right now, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>

<p>Employers are required to follow the General Duty Provision of the OSHAct, which requires them to supply employees with a safe work environment that does not have any recognized threats that cause or are likely to cause death or major injury.

<p>I have actually become fairly skilled at investigating products on line prior to purchasing them.

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it remains in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes mild impacts that are often incorrect for the influenza. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, queasiness, disorientation and tiredness. The results of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from person to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
