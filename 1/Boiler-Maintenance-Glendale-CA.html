Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.
