<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair at Elm City NC</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
