<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
