<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Riverton WY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their performance over time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
