<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
