<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Paoli IN</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in home construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
