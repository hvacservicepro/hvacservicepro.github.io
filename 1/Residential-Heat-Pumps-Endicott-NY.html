<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
