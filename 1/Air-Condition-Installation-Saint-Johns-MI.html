<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Saint Johns MI - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require relatively little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be checked a minimum of twice per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to get rid of dust collected in order to enhance collector efficiency.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
