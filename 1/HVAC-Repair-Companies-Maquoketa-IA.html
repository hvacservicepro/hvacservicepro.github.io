<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
