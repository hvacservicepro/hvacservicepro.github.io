<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

<p>I confess I have not done the math lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
