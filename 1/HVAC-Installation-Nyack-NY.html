<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
