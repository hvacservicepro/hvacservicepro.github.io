<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often vital to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this data might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
