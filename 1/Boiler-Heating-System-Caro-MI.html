The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
