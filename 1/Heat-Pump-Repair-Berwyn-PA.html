<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

York AC units are also understood for being incredibly quiet and are an excellent option when noise is a real issue.<p>
