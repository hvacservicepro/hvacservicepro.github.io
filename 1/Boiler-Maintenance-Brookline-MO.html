<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
