<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
