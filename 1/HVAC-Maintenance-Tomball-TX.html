<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family home installation company totally flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
