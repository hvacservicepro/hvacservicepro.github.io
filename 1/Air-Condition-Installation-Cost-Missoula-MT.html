<p>My oldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
