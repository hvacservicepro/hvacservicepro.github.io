<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
