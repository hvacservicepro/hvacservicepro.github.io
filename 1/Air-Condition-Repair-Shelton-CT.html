<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they've been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are expert and always on-time. Have actually been through a couple of companies for many years and Wachoff's is definitely the best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been terrific.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes.
