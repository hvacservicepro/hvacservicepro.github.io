<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
