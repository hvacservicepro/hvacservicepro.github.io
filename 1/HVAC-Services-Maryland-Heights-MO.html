<p>Professional heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new.
