<p>It's a reality that a new furnace for your home is one of the more significant costs involved in own a home. But, it should also be seen as a long-lasting investment. All of the current heating systems are much more energy-efficient than those installed even twenty years back.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
