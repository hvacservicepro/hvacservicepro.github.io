<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
