If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
