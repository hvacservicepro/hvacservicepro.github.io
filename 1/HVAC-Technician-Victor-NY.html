Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
