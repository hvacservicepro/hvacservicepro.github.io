<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon private level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in concentrations and buildings build up inside, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Place control involves moving the contaminant source away from residents or even transferring vulnerable occupants.<p>

The air quality within and around structures and structures has a huge impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
