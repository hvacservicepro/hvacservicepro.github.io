<p>Make certain there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not only will blocked vents and signs up impact your convenience, they can also result in duct leakages due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a great concept. You won't conserve any additional money and will end up triggering more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher.
