<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
