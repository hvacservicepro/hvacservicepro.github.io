<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's access panel.<p>
