<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
