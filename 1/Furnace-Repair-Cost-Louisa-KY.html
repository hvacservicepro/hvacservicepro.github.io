<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers).
