Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
