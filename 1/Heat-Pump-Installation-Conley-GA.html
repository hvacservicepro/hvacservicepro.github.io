<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While many people assume pollution is simply an outside issue, your home (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not think adequate about exposure to all the things we position in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right now, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>
<p>In addition, homeowners have a variety of alternatives to select from in powering a floor heating unit. Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As lots of property owners are all too mindful, tradition furnace systems are typically limited to running on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the marketplace for that energy source turns unstable, rates can vary, prices surge and you can end up paying more to heat your house despite how low you set your thermostat.<p>
