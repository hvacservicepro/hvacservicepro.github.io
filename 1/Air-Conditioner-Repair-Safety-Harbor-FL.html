<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
