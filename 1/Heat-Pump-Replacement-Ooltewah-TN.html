<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they need to be put. A lot of typically they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals mainly remain seated in that particular area. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
