<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
