<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home may not have sufficient ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
