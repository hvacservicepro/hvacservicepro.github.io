<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in describing what services would be carried out.

He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might want to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
