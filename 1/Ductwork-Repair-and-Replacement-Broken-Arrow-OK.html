<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
