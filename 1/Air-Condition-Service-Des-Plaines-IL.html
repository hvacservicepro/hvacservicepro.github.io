<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Des Plaines IL 60016</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

Also, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
