<p>While toxin levels from individual sources might not position a substantial health threat on their own, the majority of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a major danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that many people can take both to minimize the risk from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from happening.
