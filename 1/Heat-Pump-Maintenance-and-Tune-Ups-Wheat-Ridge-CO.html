<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are connected with exposure to toxins from microbes that can grow in big building ventilation systems.

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man comes to your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "need" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you need it.<p>
