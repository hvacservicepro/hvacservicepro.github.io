<p>Although installation is easy and does not need much time, trying this job is not a good concept.

<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit.
