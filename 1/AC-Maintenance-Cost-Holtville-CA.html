<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
