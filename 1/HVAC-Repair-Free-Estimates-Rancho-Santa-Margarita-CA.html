<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Rancho Santa Margarita CA</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
