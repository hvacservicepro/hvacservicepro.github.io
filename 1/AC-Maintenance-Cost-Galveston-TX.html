<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
