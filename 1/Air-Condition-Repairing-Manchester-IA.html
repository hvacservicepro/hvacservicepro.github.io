<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house.

An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been operating for a while, including people.
