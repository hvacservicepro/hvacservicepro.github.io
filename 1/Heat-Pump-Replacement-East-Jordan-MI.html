<p>Sean was really practical. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Many factors impact IAQ. These elements consist of poor ventilation (absence of outside air), problems managing temperature level, low or high humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air coming into the structure.
