<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on price. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they concern carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
