If you pick to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in a lot of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided guarantee will not do you any excellent ought to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the beginning and work with a certified individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
