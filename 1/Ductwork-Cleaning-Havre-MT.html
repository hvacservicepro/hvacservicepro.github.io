<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
