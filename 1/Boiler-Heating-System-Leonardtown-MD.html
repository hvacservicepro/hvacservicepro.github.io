Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective.

Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>

Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, furnishings and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
