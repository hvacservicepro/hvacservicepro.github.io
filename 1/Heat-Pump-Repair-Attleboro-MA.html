When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
