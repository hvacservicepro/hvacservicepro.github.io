<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Bell Gardens California</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
