<p>The first ac system and refrigerators utilized hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
