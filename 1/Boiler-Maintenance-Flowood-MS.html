<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this assists.<p>
