For example, we might see a window as altering somewhat with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, collects dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In truth, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials found there.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment.
