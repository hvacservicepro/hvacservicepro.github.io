The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors.
