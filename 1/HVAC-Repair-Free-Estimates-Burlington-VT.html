A standard a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
