<h3>Furnace Replacement in Somerset Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There is an essential balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE ratings typically feature greater cost. So, make sure to choose based upon how typically you will use your heating unit, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For most temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high rated heating system is not always needed.<p>
