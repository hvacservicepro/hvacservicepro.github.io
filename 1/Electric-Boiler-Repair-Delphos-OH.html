The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the producer's directions.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
