<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a new building. Forced air systems will require a water-to-air heat pump while hydronic radiant heating systems will require water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the cooling and heating requirements for your home and is important iin ensuring the performance and efficiency of the system.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>
