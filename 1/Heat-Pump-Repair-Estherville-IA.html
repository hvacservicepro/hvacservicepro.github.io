<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
