<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
