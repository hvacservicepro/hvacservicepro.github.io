<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
