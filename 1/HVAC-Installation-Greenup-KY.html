<p>Info offered in this security guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be offered for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Producers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new basic goes into effect.<p>
<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, babies, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the destructive effects of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
