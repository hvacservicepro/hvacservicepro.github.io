<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Alexandria KY</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
