<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
