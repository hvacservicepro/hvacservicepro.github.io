<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Catlettsburg KY</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
