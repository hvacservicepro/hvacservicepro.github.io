<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services in Watertown CT</h3>

<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
