<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Chandler OK</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
