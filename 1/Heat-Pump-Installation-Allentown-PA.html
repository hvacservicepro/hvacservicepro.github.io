<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioner, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too small and your a/c will not be able to cool your home correctly. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will considerably affect your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to neglect any of them.<p>
