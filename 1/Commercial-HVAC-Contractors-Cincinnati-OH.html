<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor.
