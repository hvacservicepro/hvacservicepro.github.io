<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
