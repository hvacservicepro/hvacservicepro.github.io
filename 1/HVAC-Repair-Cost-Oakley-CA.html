This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
