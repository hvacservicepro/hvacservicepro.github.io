<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.

High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
