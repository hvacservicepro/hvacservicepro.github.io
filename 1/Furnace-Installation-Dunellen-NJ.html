<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and homes matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally humid climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating unit. Radiant heat systems tend to be far more energy efficient than other heating systems, for one thing. Forced air heating unit tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output.
