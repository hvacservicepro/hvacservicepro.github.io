<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they simply didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
