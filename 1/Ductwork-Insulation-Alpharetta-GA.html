He's said a number of times that the distinct code feature is many and optional, lots of sellers don't utilize it since it decreases deals even more due to the back-and-forth communications needed. I don't know adequate about the innovation to understand if that is even possible.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
