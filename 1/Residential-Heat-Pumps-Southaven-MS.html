<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
