<p>A geothermal heating unit does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, gas, or oil. Rather, it takes in heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal heating and cooling system utilizes substantially less electricity compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating system an attractive option to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a positive effect on the environment.<p>
<p>A geothermal heater is more reliable than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and available source of energy.<p>
