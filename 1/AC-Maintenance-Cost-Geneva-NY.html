Depending on the site and pest to be managed, several of the following steps can be efficient: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular cleaning of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be decreased or avoided by making certain that wooden building products do not enter direct contact with the soil and by saving firewood far from the home.
