<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
