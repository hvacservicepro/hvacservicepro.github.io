<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in big commercial structures can not be successfully determined or fixed without an extensive structure examination. These examinations might begin with written surveys and telephone consultations in which building private investigators assess the history of resident symptoms and structure operation treatments. Sometimes, these inquiries may rapidly discover the issue and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
