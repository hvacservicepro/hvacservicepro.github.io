<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and unclean. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working efficiently, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better service. If the current system has not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
