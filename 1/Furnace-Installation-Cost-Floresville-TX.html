<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
