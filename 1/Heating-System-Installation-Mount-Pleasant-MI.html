<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
