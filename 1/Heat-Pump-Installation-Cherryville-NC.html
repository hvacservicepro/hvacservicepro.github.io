<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers throughout summers. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heater burners are examined and cleaned thoroughly prior to colder seasons begin.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace begins and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
