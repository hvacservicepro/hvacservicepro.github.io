"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
