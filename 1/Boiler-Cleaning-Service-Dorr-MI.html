<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Dorr MI</h3>
<p>Healthcare facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to decrease infection risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration. Although temperatures are often in the comfort range, some specialist treatments, such as open heart surgery, require low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and procedure applications, the goal may be to not just control temperature, however likewise humidity, air quality, and air movement from space to space.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
