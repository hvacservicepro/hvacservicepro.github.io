<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
