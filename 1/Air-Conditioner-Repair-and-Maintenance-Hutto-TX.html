<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a risk just when they are handled in a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for considerable health problems.<p>
