<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
