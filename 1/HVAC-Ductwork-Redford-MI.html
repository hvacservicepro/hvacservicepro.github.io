<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers.
