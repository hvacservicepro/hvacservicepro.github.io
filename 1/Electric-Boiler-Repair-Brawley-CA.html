<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
