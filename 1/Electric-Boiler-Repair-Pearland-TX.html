<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
