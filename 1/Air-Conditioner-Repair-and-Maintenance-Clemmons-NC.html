<p>Lots of home items release natural vapors that can cause adverse health impacts. These effects might consist of nose and throat inflammation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Products consisting of these vapors include paints, strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, pastime materials, cleaners, disinfectants, and deodorizers.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
