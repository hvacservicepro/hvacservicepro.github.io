<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at sensible energy expenses. Your furnace has numerous parts that can affect the health and wellness of you and your loved ones. Having a complete check of your furnace will offer assurance that it is safe to operate. Paragon Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Evaluation of your furnace includes a Health & Safety Analysis, which inspects the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide gas leaks and infected breathing air), checks the pilot security (surge danger), checks the high limitation (fire risk) and includes a visual assessment for other hazards.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.
