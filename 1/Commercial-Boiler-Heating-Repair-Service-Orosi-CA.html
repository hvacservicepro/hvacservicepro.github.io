<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
