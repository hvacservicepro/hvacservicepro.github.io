Protexs deal was among the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
