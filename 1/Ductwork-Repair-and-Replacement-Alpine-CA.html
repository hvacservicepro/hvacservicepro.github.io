<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.

Children may have greater exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
