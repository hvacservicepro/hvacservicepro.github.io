<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, expert and extremely well done. The installers were respectful and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize easily people who are proficient at what they do.

Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
