<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, because it is protected inside. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
