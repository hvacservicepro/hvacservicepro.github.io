<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, as opposed to outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is dedicated to supplying a work environment that is devoid of acknowledged hazards and to investigation complaints that might be associated with bad indoor air quality (IAQ).

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
