<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Lady Lake</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
