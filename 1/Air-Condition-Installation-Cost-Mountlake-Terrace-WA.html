<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
