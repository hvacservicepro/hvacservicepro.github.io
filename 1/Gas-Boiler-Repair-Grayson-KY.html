An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
