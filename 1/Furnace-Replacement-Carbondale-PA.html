<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
