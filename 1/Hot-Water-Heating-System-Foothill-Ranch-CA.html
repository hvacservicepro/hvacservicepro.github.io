<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Climate Pro is reliable and really appreciated us and our circumstance. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely glad to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right prior to a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my friends.<p>
