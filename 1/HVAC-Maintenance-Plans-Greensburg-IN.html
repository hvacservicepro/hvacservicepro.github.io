<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological threat to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Before it was known how hazardous lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air filtration technologies are becoming more common as offered options in residential and commercial HVAC item packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been extensive, as consumers stay mainly oblivious to the results of air quality on health and performance.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing contaminants. Signs of health problems caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
