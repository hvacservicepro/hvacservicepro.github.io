<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
