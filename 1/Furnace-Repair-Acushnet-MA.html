<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. The efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain since they just partly get rid of the radon decay products and do not diminish the quantity of radon going into the home. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable methods of reducing the health danger from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, supplies additional info on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).

Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>

Molekule, a residential air purifier start-up, launched a new product, now for healthcare use, and received a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Device Clearance.<p>
