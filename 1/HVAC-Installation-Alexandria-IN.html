<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<h3>HVAC System in Alexandria IN 46001</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to examine circumstance & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise replaced the heating system which was old. Everyone we talked with from starting to end were really professional, courteous and the work was really efficiently done. I would extremely advise this company.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
