<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and performance if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or extremely hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
