<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, animal hair and other particles cause problems like failure to offer adequate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you find the issue and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement alternatives variety from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That might be an extremely costly dirty-filter medical diagnosis if the technician comes to your house. This kind of cleaning work ought to be carried out in a regular basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, check our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
