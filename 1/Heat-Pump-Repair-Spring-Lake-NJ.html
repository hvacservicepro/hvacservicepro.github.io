If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
