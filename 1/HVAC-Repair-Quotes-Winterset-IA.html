<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
