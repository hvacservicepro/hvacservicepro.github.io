<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized different methods. The CMHC research study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time invested or methods utilized. The EPA research study recommended and managed techniques used on a smaller number of houses. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed because these studies were carried out, the air ducts in houses haven't.<p>
