<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and structure residents may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of gases and particles) from office makers, cleaning items, building and construction activities, carpets and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside toxins. Other elements such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues.
