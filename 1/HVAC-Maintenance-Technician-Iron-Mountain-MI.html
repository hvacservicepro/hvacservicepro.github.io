<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
