<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Narragansett RI Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
