<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne pollutants from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
