<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time.
