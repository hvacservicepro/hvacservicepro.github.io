<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it progressively tough for your lungs to operate properly, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
