<p>There are lots of things to think about when attempting to determine how frequently I should replace my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better best choice on how typically your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less often you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one a/c filter require changing more often.<p>
