<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Round Lake IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury product and more like a need.
