<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
