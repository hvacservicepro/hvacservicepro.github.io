Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
