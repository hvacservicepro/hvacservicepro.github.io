The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Producers generally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment and huge houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
