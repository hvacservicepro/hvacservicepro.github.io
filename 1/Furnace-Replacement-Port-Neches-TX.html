<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing.

The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system can produce a lot of water because they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
