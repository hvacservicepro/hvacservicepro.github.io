<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While space cooling offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
