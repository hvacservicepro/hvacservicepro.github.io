<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done quite well.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
