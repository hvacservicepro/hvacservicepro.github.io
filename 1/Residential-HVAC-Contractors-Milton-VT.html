<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
