<h3>Furnace Installation in King Of Prussia Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a few years ago.<p>
