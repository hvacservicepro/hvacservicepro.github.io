<h3>Wall Air Conditioner in Absecon NJ 08205</h3>
<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
