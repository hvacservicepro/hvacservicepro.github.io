<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
