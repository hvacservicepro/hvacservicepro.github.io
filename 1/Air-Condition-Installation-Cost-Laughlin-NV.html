A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
