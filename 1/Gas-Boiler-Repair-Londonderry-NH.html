<p>Last week, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network qualifications that were taken from a 3rd party vendor. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in concern was a heating, refrigeration and air  conditioning subcontractor that has operated at a variety of locations at Target and other leading sellers.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
