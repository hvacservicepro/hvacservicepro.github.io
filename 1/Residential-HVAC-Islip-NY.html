One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to withstand existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home, intend on spending a number of thousand dollars for the complete system.
