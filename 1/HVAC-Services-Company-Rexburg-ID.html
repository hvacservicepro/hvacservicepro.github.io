<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
