<h3>Best Heat Pump in Kenmore Washington</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
