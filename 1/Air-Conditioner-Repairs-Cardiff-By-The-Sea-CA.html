<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and perhaps refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at optimal performance and could get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy bills to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your home. If the system is too small, it will need to work harder and might overheat. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
