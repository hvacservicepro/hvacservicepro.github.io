<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized.
