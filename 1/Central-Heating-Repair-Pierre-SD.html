<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Pierre SD</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
