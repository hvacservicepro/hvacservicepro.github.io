<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
