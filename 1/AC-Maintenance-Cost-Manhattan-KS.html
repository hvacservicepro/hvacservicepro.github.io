<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Manhattan KS Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
