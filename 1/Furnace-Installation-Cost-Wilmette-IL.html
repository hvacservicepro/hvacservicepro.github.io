<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, cigarette smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in made products.

<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send out the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>
