When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
