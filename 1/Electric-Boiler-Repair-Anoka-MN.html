<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>Central Heating System in Anoka MN 55303</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
