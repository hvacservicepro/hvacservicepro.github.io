<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
