<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses. Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues.

Kids may have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

For example, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in house to save money on the energy costs and ensure the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will check the thermostat during the annual maintenance to ensure the real temperature and the temperature level on the thermostat matches.

We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
