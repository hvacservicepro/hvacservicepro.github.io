<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that best temperature level throughout the year.

Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which usually includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered.
