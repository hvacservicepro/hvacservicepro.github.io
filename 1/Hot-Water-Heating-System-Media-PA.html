<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>There's a big difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical type of home heating-- convection. Over the past century, most of homes in colder climates were warmed by convection, instead of radiation. Convection is the procedure of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floors, walls and ceilings warmed. In turn, the items in the space, like furniture and individuals, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
