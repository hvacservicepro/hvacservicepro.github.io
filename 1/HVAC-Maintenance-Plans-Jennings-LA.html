An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care products.
