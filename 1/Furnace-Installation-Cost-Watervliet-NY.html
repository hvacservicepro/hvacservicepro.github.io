<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the toxin source far from occupants or perhaps moving vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Property owners may also assume that since a glowing flooring heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will right away raise their home's worth. No proof exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Worth Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Publication. Possibly Real estate agents should think about too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system may add to, or deduct from, any given asking rate. That said, property buyers aiming to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
