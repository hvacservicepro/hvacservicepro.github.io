<p>A health survey ought to be developed and dispersed to all concerned workers. Such a tool must recognize the variety of individuals impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; determine where they are located within the office; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; recognize all machines run in the work environment; suggest the kind of outdoors air pollution; and determine prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, however lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
