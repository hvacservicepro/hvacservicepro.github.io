<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and hospitals, automobiles such as cars and trucks, trains, airplanes, submarines and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that leaves into your home without being burned off. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are normally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
