Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
