<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at Midlothian IL</h3>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many people.<p>
