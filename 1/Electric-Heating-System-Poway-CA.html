<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces in Poway CA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC units even in winter. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Initially make sure the air filter is clean and in great condition if you observe a decrease in heat output. Next, check other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, particles and dust, an economical fix that can help improve efficiency. Likewise, check the vents and ducts for blockage. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and located properly. Attempt moving it away from direct sunlight because this may affect temperature readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature level in your home. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this occurs. You might also need to inspect your insulation to ensure that warm air does not escape from your space through various openings.<p>
