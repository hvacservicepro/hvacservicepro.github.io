<p>We take a look at hints prior to we provide suggestions to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
