<p>Today's home convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. Without a doubt, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally located in one area like a bathroom flooring or be installed throughout the entire sub-surface of the home's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are often utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
