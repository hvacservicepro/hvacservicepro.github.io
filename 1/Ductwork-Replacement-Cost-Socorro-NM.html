<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne pollutants flowing through your system.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
