<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it establishes cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your home will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy costs will go up. Setting up new ductwork for the whole home will cost an average of in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
