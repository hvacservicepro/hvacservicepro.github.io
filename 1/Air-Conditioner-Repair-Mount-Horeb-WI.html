A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
