<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
