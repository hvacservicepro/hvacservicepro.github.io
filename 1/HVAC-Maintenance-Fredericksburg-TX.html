<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, since it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.
