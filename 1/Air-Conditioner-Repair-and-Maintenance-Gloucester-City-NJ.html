<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Mobile homes are usually smaller sized than stick-built homes and use considerably less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat.
