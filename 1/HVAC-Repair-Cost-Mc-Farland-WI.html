<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms.
