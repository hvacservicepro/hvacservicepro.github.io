<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping device to circulate warm water that warmed their stone floors.

<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>

Likewise, housing prices in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as a result, more recent houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Many attics are likewise being transformed to end up bedrooms to add extra area. Spaces in the upper areas of houses are particularly susceptible to getting very hot and unpleasant throughout the summertime, making a/c even more needed.<p>
