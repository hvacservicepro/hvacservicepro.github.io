<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't know why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to defrost your cooling devices. The most convenient method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
