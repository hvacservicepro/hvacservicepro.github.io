<h3>Heating Service in Kenedy Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty.
