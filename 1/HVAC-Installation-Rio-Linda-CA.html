<p>Typically the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
