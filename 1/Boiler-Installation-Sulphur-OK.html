<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply adding refrigerant is not an option if it leakages. A skilled technician should repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant.
