<h3>Furnace Replacement in Grand Blanc Michigan</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 major parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
