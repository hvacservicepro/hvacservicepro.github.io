<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
