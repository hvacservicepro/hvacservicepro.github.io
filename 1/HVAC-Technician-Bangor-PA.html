If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
