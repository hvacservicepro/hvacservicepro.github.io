<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Charleston IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
