<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
