<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
