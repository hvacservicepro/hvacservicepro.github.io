<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company in Chattanooga TN</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be set up in all bathrooms and kitchens. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are peaceful and long lasting. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to guarantee the fans run for an adequate period of time. A good rule of thumb is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
