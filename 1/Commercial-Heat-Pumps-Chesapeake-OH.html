<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is usually greater than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you buy. Among the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating alternatives. This suggests it can warm up your home to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
