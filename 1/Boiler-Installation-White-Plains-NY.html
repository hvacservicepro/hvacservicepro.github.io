<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>We needed two sees - Jake came out initially and was extremely knowledgeable and enjoyable and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later on and was also well-informed and great to speak with. They both did a fantastic task. Sabre's workplace staff is extremely practical, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and supplying the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly recommend.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>

<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, humans breathe out co2, which in little quantities is not harmful, however might become harmful if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the entire workplace or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
