These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
