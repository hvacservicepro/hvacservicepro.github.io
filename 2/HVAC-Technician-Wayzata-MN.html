<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But much of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>There are numerous sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, tobacco, wood, and coal items; structure products and home furnishings as varied as scrubby, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or wet carpet, and kitchen cabinetry or furnishings made of particular pressed wood products; items for home cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outside sources such as radon, pesticides, and outside air contamination.<p>

That said, property buyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
