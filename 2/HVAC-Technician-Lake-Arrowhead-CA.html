<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
