<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing fractures and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
