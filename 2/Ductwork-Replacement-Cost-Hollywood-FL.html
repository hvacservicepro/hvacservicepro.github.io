For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the tools or skills needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
