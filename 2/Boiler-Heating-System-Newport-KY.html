<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
<p>A third method to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house may not have enough ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To spot odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
