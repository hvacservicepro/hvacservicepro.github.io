<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep.
