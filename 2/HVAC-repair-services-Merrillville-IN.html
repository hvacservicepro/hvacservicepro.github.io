<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned up.

The following are guidelines; always refer to your owner's manual. Keep in mind: Constantly switch off the power before cleaning the system.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually identified building products, furnishings, and mold as severe concerns, however much of the threat also comes from burning things.

This is a particularly big issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions.

Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
