<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, commercial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The crucial portion of your cooling is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its positioning on your residential or commercial property and its maintenance, it may sustain some damage during the winter season. Most of the time, this just consists of some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty simple to get rid of. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from collected moisture, or excessive wear to the outside. They might recommend that you trim thick trees or bushes to make sure sufficient air flow around the unit.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
