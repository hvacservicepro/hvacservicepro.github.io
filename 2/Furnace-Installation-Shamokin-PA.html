<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
