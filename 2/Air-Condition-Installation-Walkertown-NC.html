<p>Specializing in residential and commercial cooling installation, Around the Clock Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc. is devoted to keeping clients in Rye Brook, NY great and cool.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
