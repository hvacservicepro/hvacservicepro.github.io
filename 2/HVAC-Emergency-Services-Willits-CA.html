<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized.

Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
