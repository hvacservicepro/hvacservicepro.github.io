<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
