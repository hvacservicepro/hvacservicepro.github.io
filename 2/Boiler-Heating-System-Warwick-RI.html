<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>More common in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical power, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can accomplish approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
