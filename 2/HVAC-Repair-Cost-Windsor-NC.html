<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Windsor NC</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
