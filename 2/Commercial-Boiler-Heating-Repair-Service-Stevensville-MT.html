<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also appear soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you know it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate effects that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, queasiness, fatigue and disorientation. The results of CO direct exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
