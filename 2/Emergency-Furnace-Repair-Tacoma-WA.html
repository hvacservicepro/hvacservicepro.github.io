<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Climate Pro is reliable and really cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that very same night.

Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week!
