<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were informative and handy, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better deal, for extraordinary service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heater and located ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but significant changes in his bid. Since of recent warmer summers and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
