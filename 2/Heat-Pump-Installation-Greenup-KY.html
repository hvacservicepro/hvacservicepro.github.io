<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not exceed the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not basic, considering that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit.
