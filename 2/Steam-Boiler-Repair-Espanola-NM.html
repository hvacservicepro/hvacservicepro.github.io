Permeable materials, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
