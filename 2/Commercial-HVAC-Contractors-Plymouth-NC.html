<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
