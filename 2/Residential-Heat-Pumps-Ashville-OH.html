<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if needed, update the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>A/c manufacturers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioner stops working, start by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers.
