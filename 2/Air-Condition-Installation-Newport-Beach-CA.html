<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Newport Beach CA 92660</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
