<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
