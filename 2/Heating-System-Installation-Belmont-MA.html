<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
