At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards usually amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with standard equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building and construction (homes normally use in between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
