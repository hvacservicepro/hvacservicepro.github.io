Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
