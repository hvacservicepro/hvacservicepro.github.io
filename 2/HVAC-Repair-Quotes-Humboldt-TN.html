<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective.

The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
