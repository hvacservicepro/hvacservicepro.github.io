<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
