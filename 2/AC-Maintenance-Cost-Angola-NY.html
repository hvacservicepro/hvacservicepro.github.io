To obtain state company contacts, compose or call EPA's IAQ Information Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. location.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Please schedule a visit for a medical evaluation at the University Staff Member Occupational Health Center by calling 919-966-9119 if you believe there is a health concern related to the indoor environment.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
