<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently.
