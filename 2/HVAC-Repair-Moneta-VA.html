<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs totally by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
