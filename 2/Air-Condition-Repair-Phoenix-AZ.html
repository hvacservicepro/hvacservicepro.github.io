<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal components too. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous rooms at the same time, but are not very energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.
