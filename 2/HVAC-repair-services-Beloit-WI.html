<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a very efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below.

And due to the fact that each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can say goodbye to thermostat warfare when a single person would choose it a little warmer in a different room.<p>
