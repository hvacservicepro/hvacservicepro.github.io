<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
