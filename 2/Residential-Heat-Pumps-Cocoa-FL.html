<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.
