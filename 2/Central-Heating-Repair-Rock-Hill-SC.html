<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
