While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to likewise be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the house.

In addition, citizens need to be alert to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization procedures ought to not be undertaken till these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we supply suggestions to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy.
