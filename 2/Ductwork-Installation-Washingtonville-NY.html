<h3>HVAC Duct Repair in Washingtonville NY 10992</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
