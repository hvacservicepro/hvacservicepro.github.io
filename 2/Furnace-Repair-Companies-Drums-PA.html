<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
