Soil by roadways and highways might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to getting in the house. Alter your clothes before you go house and wash these clothes separately if you work with lead in your task or a pastime. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which adheres to toys and fingers. Try to keep your children from consuming dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come inside.<p>
