Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
