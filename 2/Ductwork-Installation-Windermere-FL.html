<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is protected inside.

New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
