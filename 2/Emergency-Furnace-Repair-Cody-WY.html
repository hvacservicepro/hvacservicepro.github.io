I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on price. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
