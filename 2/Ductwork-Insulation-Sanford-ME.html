<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
