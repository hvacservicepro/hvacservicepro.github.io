PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them.

PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room a/c provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
