<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
