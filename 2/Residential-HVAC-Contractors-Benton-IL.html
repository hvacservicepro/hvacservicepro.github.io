<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can imply considerable savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
