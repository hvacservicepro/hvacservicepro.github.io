<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices. The easiest way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
