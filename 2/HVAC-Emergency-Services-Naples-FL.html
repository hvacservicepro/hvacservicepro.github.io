<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
