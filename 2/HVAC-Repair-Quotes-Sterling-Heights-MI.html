For example, Apex just recently presented operating software application and accounting systems to standardize innovation, KPIs, and financial insights across the group. The acquiring companies can generate some top executives who include a level of professionalism the companies may have been doing not have.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
