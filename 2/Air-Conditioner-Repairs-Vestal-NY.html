<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, consisting of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxic substances.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
