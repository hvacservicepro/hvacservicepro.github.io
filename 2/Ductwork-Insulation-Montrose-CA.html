<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be acquired and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>
