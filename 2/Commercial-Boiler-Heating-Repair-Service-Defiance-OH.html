<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
