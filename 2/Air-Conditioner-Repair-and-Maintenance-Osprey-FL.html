<p>These men have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Recently I required to call on these guys twice. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, it's an organisation design they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big company in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
