<p>The exhaust outlets permit all unsafe gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can result in an unsafe accumulation and compromise your security. The technician will evaluate all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will search for indications of corrosion, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
