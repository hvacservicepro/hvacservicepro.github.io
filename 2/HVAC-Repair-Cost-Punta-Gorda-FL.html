Simply put, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
