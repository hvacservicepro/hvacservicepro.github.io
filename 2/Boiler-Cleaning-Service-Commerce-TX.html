<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the pipes. Install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
