For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the best temperature level.

However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice.
