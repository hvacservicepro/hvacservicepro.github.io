<p>All Points Heating provides home air conditioning, air conditioner installation, a/c maintenance that deliver trustworthy, proven efficiency at high effectiveness. Combustion products from vehicle exhaust, heaters, water heaters, area heating units, fragrant candles, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not properly vented can produce carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products might result in nose, throat, and eye irritation; tiredness; dizziness; and queasiness.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still warms to the right temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel really hot. If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should contact an expert to repair the unit and check.<p>
