<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
