<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
