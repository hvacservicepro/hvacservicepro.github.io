<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
