<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant.

There are lots of methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
