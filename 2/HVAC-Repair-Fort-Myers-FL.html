Before we style and install any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Standard improvements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend several qualified house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for references.<p>

<h3>Boiler Installation in Fort Myers FL 33908</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of adequate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in more than half the work environment indoor air examinations it has actually performed. Investigations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
