<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
