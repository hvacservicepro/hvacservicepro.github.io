<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years old, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a simple problem like debris clogging the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, however likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house. Improving those aspects might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air.

<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air.

Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for instance, can be useful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
