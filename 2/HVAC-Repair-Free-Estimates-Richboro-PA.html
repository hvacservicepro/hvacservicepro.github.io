<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
