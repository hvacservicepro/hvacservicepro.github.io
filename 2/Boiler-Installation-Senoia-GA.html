<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions ought to also be required to reduce pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps should not be carried out till these issues have been fixed.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
