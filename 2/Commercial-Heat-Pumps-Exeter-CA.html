<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow constraint will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
