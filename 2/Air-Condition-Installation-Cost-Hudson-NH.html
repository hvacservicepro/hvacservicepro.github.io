<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
