<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the a/c is large, it might not achieve a low humidity.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
