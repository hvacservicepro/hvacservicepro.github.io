<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources.

The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
