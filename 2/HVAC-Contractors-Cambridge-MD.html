<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
