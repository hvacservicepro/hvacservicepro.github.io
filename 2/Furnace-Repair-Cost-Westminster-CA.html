<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use.

Heaters that kick on often might be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
