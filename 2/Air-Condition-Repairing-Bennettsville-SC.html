<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
