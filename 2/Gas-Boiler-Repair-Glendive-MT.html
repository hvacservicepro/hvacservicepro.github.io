<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Glendive Montana</h3>
<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi yearly maintenance today. Trace was on time, considerate, and appreciated my home by always wearing boot coverings when entering my house. He showed the points of evaluation and also suggested I have a UV light set up due to a little buildup of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he completely inspected and cleaned up the outside compressor coils as well as ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also removed the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor unit and suggested a solution to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed e-mail report of the assessment outlining all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I extremely suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is even more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
