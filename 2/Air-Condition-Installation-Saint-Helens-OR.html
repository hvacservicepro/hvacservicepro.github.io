<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Saint Helens OR</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
