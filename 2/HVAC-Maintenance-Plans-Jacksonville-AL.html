<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
