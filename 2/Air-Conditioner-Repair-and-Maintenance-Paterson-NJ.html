The air was cooled, and consequently the quantity of moisture in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the space manageable. The regulated temperature level and humidity assisted maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment.

The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
