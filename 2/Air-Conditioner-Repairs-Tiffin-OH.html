<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health results pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the impacts noted take place at the pollutant concentration levels normally found in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed effects could occur.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
