<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced routinely.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
