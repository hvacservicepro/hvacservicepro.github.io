<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Lake Park</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become an important concern to property owners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution research studies have determined several pollutants that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion items, unstable natural compounds (consisting of formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are essential in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
