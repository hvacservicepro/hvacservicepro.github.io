<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Dawsonville GA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
