<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
