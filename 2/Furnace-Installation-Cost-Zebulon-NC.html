<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floorings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
