<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Seymour Indiana</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
