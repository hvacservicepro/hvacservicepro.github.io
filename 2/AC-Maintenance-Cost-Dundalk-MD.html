<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
