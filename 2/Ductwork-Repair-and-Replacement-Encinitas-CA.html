<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
