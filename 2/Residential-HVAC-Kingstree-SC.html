<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives usually amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional devices.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
