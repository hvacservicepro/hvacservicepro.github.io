Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
