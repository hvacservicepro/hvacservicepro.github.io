<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
