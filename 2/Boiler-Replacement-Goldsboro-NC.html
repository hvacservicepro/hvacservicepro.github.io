<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Property owners may likewise assume that since a glowing flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will immediately raise their house's worth.
