<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
