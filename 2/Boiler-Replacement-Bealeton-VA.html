<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time.

I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
