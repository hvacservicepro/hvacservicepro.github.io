<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still does not work properly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
