When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
