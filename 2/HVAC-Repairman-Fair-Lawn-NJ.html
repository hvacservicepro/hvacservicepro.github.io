<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Fair Lawn New Jersey</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There are some more serious risks for HVAC workers that could be possibly deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be toxic. As HVAC technicians regularly enter contact with circuitry, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other kinds of burns and abrasions to the skin. Although there are risks associated with the task, it is generally performed securely as long as appropriate care is taken.<p>
