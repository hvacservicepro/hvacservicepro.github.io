<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and homes matters, especially because we spend the majority of our lives indoors. A/c unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid environments or in cases where the a/c is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
