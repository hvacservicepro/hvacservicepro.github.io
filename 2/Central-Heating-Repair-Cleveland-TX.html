<p>Many people undervalue the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is typically pictured as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the house. To compound the issue, it is approximated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside, and more than half that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that provide gas to your furnace must also be examined frequently. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire danger. Detached fuel lines can compromise the performance of the HVAC system as well. Soot can build up in burners and broken heat exchanger s can have an impact on the system's effectiveness also.

<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard a/c in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air path. A standard a/c transfers heat energy out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
