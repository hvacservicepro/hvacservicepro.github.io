<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Connelly Springs NC?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
