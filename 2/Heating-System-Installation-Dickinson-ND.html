The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was.
