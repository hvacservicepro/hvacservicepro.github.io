<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, since the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
