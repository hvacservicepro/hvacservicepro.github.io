<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced.
