Many home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
