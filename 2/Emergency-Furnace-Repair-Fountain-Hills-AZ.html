<p>Remember that the SEER score is calculated utilizing the same set of temperatures across the board. The typical summer temperature to come to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the proper SEER ranking for your area, deduct 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking has to be at least 13 for all new cooling units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
