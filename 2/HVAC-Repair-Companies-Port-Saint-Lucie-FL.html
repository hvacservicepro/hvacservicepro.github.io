<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be extreme. They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Children may have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
