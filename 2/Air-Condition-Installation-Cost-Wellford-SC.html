<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
