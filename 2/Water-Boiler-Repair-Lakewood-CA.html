<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up.
