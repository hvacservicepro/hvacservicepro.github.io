<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health threat reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new homeowner I have found out how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
