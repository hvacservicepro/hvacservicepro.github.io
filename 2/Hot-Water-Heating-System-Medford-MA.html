<h3>The Way to Choose An Expert HVAC Tech in Medford MA</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
