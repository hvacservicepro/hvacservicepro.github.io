The best thing to do is ensuring that the heating unit burners are examined and cleaned up completely prior to chillier seasons start.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
