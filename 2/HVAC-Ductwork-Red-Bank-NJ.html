<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in numerous countless asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Lots of people are becoming more worried and mindful about their health and the impact of indoor air quality.

Beacon Plumbing, Seattle, WA cleans the air ducts physically by eliminating the particles from the air filter.<p>
