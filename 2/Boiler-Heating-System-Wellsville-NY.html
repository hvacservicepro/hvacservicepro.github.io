<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
