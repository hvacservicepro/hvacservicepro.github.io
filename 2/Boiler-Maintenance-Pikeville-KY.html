<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply radiant systems.
