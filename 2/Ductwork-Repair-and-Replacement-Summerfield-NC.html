<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Summerfield NC</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is because something is filthy or clogged up Before trying to fix any issue, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, check the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it. If this does not work, have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, contact a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
