<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
