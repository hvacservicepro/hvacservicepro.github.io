<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
