<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The capability of natural chemicals to cause health results differs greatly, from those that are extremely hazardous, to those without any known health result. As with other contaminants, the degree and nature of the health effect will depend on many elements consisting of level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual conditions, and memory disability are among the immediate symptoms that some individuals have experienced right after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is understood about what health results happen from the levels of organics generally found in homes. Lots of natural compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are believed of triggering, or are understood to cause, cancer in humans.<p>
