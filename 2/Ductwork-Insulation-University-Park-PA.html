<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
