<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Easton PA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>

<p>Unclean Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, animal hair and other debris cause problems like failure to offer sufficient heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time.

When they are handled in a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these items present a threat only.

This can lead to the capacity for substantial illness.<p>
