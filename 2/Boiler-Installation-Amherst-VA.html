<h3>Picking the Right HVAC System For Your Job in Amherst VA</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months before the present one ended. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
