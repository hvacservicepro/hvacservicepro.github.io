<h3>Central Heating System in Ukiah CA 95482</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or abilities essential to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
