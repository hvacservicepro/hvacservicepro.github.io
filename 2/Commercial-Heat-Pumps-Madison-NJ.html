<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
