<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Fairfield New Jersey</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was really happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed concerns. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
