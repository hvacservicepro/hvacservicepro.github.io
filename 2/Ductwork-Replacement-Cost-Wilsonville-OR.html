<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we resolved problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
