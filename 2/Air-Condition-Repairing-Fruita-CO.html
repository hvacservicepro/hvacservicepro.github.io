Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and situated methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial but minor changes in his bid. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump due to the fact that of recent warmer summers and for environmental factors.<p>

PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
