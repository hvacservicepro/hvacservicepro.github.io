<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
