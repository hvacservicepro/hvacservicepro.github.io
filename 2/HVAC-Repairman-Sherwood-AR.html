<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>

If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
