<p>House owners may also presume that because a glowing floor heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will immediately raise their house's worth. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively affects property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Publication. Perhaps Realtors need to consider a lot of variables to definitively specify what a radiant heat system may add to, or subtract from, any provided asking rate. That said, property buyers aiming to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
