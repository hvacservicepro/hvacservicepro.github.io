<h3>A Look At Ductwork At Flint MI Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>I was extremely pleased in the beginning because things ran smoothly with no sound. Furthermore, I saw visible changes in my electrical energy bills. After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has been a good experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or below 65%.
