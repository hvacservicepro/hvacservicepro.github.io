<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially costly to set up, particularly in an older house. Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're highly adverse dust.

Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>
