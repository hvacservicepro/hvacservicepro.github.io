<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and efficient  method to minimize ambient air pollution and potential health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually greater than lots of heatpump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you purchase. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating choices.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit.
