<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can imply considerable cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
