All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
