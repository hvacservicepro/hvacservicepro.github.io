<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will reduce the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
