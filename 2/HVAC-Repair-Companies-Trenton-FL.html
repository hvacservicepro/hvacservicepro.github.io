<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
