<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
