<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
