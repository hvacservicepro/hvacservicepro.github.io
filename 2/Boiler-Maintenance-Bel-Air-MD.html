<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside. Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house.

Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors eliminate impurities directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
