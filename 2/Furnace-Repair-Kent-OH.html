<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at affordable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of system for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>A/c manufacturers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your ac system stops working, start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
