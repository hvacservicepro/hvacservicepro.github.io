The average summer season temperature level to get to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to reach the correct SEER rating for your area, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c units manufactured in the United States.<p>

It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each space in your home, and if it establishes fractures which leakage, they need to be fixed. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with worse results. Your house will not be adequately cooled, and your energy expenses will increase. Installing new ductwork for the whole house will cost an average of in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your physician about them. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
