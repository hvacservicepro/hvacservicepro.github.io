<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair in Washington IN</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is a financial investment that spends for itself over the years, however only if you protect it to the best of your ability. Thankfully, this does not have to be a task! We take care of everything when you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance strategy. No matter what make or model of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual evaluations, marked down diagnostics, top priority service, and fantastic offers on repairs and replacements.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
