<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
