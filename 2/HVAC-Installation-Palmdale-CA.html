<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy efficient than models made even 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to replace or update your system if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the exact same amount of cooling.<p>
