<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in regards to environmental costs. Since the energy utilized to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground, it secures the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
