In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate symptoms but can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality items. If your air conditioner fails, begin by inspecting any merges or breaker.
