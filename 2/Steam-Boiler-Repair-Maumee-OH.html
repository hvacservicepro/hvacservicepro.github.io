<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.
