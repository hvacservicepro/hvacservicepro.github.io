<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide, radon, unstable organic substances ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce unfavorable health conditions.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize.
