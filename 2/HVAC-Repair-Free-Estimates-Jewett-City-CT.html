<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
