<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to buy it. My wife stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually met in a long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
