<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
