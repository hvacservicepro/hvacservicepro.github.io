<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Windham Maine</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
