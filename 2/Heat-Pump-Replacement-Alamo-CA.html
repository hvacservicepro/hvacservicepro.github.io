<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stale air might likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result.
