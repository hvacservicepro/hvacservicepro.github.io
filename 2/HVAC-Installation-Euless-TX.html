Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
