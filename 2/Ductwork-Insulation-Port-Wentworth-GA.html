<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Port Wentworth GA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioning unit before you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
