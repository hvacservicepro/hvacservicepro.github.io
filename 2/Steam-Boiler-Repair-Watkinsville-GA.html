<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled.
