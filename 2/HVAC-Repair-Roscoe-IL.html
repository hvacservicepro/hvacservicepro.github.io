<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, fetuses, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the damaging impacts of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Roscoe IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12.
