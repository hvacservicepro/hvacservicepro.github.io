The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled.

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
