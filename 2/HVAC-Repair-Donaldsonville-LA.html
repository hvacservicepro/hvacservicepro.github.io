The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the heating & cooling requirements for your home and is critical iin ensuring the effectiveness and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in tons. Usually, a 3-ton setup should suffice for the typical home, however house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land availability are all factors which will influence the correct size for your specific house.
