<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-410a and r-404a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
