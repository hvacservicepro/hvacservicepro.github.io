<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
