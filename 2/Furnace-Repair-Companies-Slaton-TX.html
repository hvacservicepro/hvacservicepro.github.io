<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats.
