<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs entirely by supplying a professional quote with options, without pushing additional items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
