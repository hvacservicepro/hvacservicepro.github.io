<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of unusual being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed concerns. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
