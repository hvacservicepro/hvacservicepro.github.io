<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow constraint will reduce the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
