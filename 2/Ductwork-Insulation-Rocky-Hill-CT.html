<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
