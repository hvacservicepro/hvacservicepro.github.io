<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
