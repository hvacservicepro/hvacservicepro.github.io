Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
