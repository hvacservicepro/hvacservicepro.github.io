<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance advantage. Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
