<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
