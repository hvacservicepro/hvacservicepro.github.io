These different heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure.
