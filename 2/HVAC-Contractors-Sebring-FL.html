<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
