When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors.

<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles.
