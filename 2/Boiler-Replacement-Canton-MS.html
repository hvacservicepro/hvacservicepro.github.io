<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
