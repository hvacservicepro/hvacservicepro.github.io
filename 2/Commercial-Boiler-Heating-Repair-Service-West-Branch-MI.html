<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer must check measurements of humidity, air and temperature level flow. In addition, assessment and testing of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for constructing usage and tenancy) should be carried out.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
