<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two ought to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electricity. The 2 operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
