<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to examine and, if required, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more reliable solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
