<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which generally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
