<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
