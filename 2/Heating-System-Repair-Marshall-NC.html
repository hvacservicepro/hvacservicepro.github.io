<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
