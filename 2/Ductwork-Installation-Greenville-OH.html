<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest considerable savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can optimize effectiveness and provide longer long lasting home heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can identify a concern that will require a significant financial investment to treat. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the expensive repair and delight in ongoing convenience from your present heater? Or, do you make an even bigger financial commitment to replacing the furnace? The decision to change or repair depends on you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides higher energy performance and features service warranty protection.<p>
