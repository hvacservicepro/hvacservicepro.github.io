<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior.
