<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
