<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My spouse stated that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have actually satisfied in a long period of time.

When the fireplace is in usage, constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
