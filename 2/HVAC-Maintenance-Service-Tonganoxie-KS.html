In other cases, such modifications discreetly and even significantly alter buildings in ways that may be essential to their own integrity or their influence on structure occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, some of the methods used by scientists studying communities, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
