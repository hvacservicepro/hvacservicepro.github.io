<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
