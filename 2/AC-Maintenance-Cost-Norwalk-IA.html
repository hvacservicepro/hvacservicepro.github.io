<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heaters can heat your house.

<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and flooring coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
