Depending upon the site and bug to be controlled, several of the following actions can be reliable: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and pets. Termite damage can be lowered or prevented by making sure that wooden structure materials do not enter direct contact with the soil and by keeping fire wood far from the home. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be dramatically decreased.<p>
