They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems.

Kids may have higher direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
