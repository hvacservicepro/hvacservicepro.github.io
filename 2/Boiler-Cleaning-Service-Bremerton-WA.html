Localized glowing floor heat systems to be used in one or a number of spaces like bathrooms, cooking areas or utility room are quickly renovated with electric glowing floor heat. This is far more cost-effective on a smaller scale. Larger renovations like additions to a home may be suitable for a bigger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>

Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making sure that wooden building products do not enter direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood far from the home. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be dramatically lowered.<p>
