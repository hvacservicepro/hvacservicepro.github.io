<p>For example, issues arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outdoor air.

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Morgan Hill CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Buy education and training: HVAC is not "guideline" work, and no 2 houses are the same. When technicians are properly trained, they pick and set up efficient, safe devices. They know what it implies to offer first-class craftsmanship, and they get fewer callbacks from disappointed customers. Managers and founders need to likewise stay abreast of progressing innovations and market best practices.<p>
