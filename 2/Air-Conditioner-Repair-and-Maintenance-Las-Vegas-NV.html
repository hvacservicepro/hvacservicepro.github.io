<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is simply as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will typically develop in ductwork, restricting air flow.
