<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
