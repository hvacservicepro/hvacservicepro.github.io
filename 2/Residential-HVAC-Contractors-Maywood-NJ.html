Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
