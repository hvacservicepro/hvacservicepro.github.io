<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Houghton Lake MI 48629</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on rare occasions.<p>
