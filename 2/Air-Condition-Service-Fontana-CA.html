<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
