<h3>Boiler Heating System in Cobleskill New York</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>
