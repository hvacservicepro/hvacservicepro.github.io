<p>I have been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales male concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and must not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
