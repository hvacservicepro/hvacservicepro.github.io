<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
