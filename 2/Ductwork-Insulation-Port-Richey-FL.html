<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
