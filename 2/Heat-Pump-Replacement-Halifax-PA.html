<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
