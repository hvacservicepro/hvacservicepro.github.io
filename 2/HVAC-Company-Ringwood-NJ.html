<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health results pointed out. However, it is not always real that the impacts kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the home. Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed effects might take place.<p>
<p>To begin, it's a great idea to think of energy performance. By picking a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can minimize your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run. Effectiveness scores must be identified with all systems. While effective units may cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated device is an excellent method to take pleasure in additional comfort.<p>

Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
