<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the existing system has not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
