<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are especially at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the type of particles and gases) from office machines, cleaning products, construction furnishings, carpets and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
