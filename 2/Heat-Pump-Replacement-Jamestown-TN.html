<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
