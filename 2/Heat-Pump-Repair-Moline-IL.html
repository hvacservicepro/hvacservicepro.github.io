<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is usually acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, because it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
