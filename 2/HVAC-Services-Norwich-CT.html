<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Norwich CT</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

<p>Ensure there are no rugs, furnishings, or anything else restricting the flow of air.
