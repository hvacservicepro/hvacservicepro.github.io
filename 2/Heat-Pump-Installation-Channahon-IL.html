<p>Resideo uses a range of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System options for both new building and retrofit applications. Breathing air pollutants can lead to allergic and asthmatic responses, infections and other health problems that involve the lungs, nose and throat.

Pre-owned smoke is also damaging to individuals, specifically kids.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
