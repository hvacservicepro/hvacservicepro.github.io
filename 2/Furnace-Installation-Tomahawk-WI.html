<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem.

<h3>AC Compressor in Tomahawk Wisconsin</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service concerned us for that reason. Typically they were initially thinking about from another location keeping track of some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses.
