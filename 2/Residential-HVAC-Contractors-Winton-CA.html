<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you currently have a home heating unit, you might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
