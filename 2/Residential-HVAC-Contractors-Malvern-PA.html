<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of incomplete combustion.

The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
