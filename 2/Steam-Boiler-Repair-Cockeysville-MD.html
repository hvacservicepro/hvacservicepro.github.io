<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
