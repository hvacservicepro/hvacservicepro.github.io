<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings constantly develop as a result of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously engaging, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as altering slightly over time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned up, collects dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be developing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes gas, oil or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private spaces.

More recent gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect.

Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
