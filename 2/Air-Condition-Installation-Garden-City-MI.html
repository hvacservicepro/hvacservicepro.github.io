<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may observe undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

The results of CO exposure can differ significantly from individual to individual depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
