<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Sun City AZ 85351</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
