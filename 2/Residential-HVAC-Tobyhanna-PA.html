<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Many times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
