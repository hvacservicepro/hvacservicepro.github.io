<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
