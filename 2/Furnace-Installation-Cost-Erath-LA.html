<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can likewise arise from lead dust from outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked within, and usage of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Additionally, house owners have a range of alternatives to pick from in powering a flooring heating system. Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
