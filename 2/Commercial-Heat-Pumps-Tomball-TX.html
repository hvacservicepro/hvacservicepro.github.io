<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.
