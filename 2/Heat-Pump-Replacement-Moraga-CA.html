It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
