<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations develop inside, direct exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
