<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Know in Danielson CT</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
