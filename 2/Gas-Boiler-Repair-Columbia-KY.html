On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and find you require to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses throbbing.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
