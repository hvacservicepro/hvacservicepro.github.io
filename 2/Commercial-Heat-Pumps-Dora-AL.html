Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may end up being clogged, decreasing air circulation quality, circulation, and volume.

The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
