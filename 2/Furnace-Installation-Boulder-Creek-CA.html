These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Since the energy used to heat your home is extracted straight from the ground, it safeguards the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heater can also be linked to a device called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heat pump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This implies that this device can also supply totally free hot water for domestic use in addition to its traditional geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
