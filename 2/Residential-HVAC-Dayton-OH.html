<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
