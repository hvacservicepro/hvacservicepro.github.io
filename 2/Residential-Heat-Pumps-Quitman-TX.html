<p>A regular furnace tune up can maximize efficiency and offer longer lasting house heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can recognize a concern that will require a substantial investment to remedy. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the expensive repair and enjoy ongoing comfort from your present heating system? Or, do you make an even larger financial commitment to changing the furnace?
