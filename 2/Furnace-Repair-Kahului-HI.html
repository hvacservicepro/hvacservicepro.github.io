They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system".

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
