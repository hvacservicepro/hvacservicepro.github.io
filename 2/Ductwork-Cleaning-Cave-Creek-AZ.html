<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
