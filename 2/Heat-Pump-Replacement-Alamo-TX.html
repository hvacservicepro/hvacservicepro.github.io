<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores circulating through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older homes might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In bathrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are managed in a method that produces dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these items provide a threat only. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the capacity for significant health problems.<p>
