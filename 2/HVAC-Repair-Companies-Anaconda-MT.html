<p>The toxins noted in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health impacts mentioned. However, it is not always true that the effects noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels normally found in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health effects is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could occur.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
