<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
