<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible. It is likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
