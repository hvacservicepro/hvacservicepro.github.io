<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be successfully recognized or treated without a comprehensive structure investigation.
