<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
