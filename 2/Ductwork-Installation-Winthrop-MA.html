<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>When your house's furnace stops working, your home can have more issues than simply being uncomfortable.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
