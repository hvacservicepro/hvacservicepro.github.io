<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
