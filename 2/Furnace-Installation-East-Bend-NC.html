A building walk-through to look for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be valuable. Leakages require to be gotten rid of.

In some circumstances, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of building occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
