<p>The lifespan of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's ac system are more energy effective than designs made 5 years back, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's five years of ages or older.

<h3>Air Condition Company in Laurel Maryland</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace need to also be inspected routinely. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire danger. Detached fuel lines can jeopardize the performance of the HVAC system too. Soot can build up in burners and cracked heat exchanger s can have an effect on the system's performance too. The maintenance. technicians will examine all of these aspects of the furnace and thoroughly and eliminate all obstructions and traces of soot.<p>
<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 30 days during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Simply a couple of years back, Seattle saw a record temperature of 103 degrees, and there have been a lot of long, dry, hot streaks since then. A central air system in your home indicates you have the power to change the temperature level to a consistent temperature level when the heat gets unbearable.<p>

Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
