<p>Picking the ideal size air conditioning system is a crucial part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to help you with.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor begins but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut down the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you've offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
