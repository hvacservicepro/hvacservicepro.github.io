<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heating system) with the very same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
