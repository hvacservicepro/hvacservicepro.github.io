As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>

YORK products are backed by some of the very best limited service warranties in business, consisting of YORK's factory-backed guarantee.
