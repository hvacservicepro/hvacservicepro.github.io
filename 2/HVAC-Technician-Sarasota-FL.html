With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its abilities, enabling an enhanced worth proposal for a wider set of clients.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
