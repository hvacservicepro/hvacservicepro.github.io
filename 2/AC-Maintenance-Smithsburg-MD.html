<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
<p>Numerous people are becoming more aware and concerned about their health and the effect of indoor air quality.
