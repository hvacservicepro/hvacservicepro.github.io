<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Fayetteville GA</h3>
<p>Everyone face a variety of risks to our health as we tackle our day-to-day lives. Driving in cars, flying in airplanes, taking part in leisure activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all pose varying degrees of risk. Some threats are simply unavoidable. Some we pick to accept due to the fact that to do otherwise would limit our ability to lead our lives the way we desire. If we had the chance to make educated choices, and some are dangers we might decide to avoid. Indoor air pollution is one danger that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
