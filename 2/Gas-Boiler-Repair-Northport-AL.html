Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
