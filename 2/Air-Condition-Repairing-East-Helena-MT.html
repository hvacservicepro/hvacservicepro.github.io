Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
