In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Room air conditioning system include a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control board, which determines the temperature of air entering into the evaporative coil. The air conditioner might cycle continuously or act unpredictably if the sensor is knocked out of position. The sensor needs to be near the coil however not touching it; adjust its position by carefully bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>
