<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
