<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows.

You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Air-Conditioning, refrigerating and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can exacerbate problems.
