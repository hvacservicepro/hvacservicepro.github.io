<p>Iâ $ m really choosy with my things. I like my devices and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioning system to replace my old one was somewhat of a challenging fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am pleased I got this though since it has restored my faith in good manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Carrier I got because I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s simply ideal.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
