<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Altamonte Springs FL 32714</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
