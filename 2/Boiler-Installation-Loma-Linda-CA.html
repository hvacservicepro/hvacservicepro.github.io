<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss short cycling in extremely winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will simply run harder to maintain a warm environment for your home when the weather is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you require clarity on this problem, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered remarkable, personalized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction style is friendly, reliable and engaging. He clearly and thoroughly discussed all problems and repairs in a way that made me positive in his capability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my partner and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a temporary fix to an issue that could not be solved on the first check out due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
