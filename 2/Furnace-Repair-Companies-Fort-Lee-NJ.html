<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>

Preventive procedures consist of changing typical hot water levels to enable 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, assessing facility style layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect locations.<p>
