If you're trying to find a new heater for your house, you need to take a look at some of the other options readily available prior to picking a system that might not fit your requirements best. Radiant heat, for example, may be a much better fit for your requirements.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each space in your house, and if it establishes cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with worse results. Your house will not be properly cooled, and your energy bills will go up. Installing new ductwork for the entire house will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
