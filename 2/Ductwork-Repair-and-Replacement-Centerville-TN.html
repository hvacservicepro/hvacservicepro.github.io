<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
