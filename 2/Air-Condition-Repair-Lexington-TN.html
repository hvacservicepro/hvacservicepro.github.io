<p>These people have been great. At a realtor, I in some cases need contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Recently I needed to call on these guys twice. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't just their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
