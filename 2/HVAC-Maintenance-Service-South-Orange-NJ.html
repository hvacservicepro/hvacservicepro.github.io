<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC person and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
