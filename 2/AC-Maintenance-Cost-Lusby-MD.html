<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a very helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
