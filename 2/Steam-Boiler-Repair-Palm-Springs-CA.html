<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
