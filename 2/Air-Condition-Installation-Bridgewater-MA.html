<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Bridgewater Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the go to. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
<p>We have actually had more than 100 years to apply our proficiency to take care of your heating and cooling requirements.

<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. , if it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
