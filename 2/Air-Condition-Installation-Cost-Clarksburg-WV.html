<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
