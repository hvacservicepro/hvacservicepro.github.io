<p>Improve your services, earn more services earnings, and provide an incredible client experience. To make sure the system you select is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to identify the precise type of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we don't just replace it with the same size unit you currently have. These estimations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is necessary so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
