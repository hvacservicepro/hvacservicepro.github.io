<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
