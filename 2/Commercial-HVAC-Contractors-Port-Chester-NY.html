<p>The most common type of home heating system in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive option, however newer systems can be very energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective gas heaters can attain AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
