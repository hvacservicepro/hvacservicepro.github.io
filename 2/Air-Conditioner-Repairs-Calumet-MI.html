<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this.
