<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
