<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
