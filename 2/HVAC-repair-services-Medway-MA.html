<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if required, upgrade the structure envelope.

Insulation might be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
