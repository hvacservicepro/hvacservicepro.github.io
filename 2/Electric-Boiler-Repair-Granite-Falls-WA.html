<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
