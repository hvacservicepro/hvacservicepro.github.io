Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance check outs annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and normally some other advantages. Some companies offer top priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>

<p>We have been extremely delighted with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed annual maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has worked very well and is so efficient that it significantly lowered our energy expenditures - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we have needed them for emergencies they responded quickly and resolved the problem.<p>
