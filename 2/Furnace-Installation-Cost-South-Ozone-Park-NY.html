<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water supplies, it has been discovered in well water. If you've tested the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, call a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Think about an entire house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old sufficient to validate replacement. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can delight in some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
