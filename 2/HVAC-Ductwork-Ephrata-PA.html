<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
