<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop up inside your home.<p>

<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and reliable  technique to reduce ambient air pollution and potential health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes include generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
