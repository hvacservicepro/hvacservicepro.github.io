<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have.
