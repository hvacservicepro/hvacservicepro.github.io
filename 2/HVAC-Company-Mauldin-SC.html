<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Mauldin SC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
