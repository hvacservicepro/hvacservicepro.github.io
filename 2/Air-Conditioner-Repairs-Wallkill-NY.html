<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
