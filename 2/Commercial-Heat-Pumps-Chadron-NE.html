<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
