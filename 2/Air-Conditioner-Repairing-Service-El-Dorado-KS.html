<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs totally by supplying an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
