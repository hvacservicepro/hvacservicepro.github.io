<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Kenly NC</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants produced by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
