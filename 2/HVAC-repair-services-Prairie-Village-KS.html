<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Prairie Village KS</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has actually indicated that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study shows that people spend roughly 90 percent of their time inside.

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
