My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
