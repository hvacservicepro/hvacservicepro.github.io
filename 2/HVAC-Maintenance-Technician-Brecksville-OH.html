<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
