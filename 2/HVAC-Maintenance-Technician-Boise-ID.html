Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
