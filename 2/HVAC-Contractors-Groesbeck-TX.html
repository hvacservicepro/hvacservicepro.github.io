Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
