<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
