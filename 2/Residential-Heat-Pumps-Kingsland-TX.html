<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
