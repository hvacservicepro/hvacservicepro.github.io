<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was type of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is a very common repair.

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
