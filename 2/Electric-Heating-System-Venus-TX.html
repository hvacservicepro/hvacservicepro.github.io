<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
