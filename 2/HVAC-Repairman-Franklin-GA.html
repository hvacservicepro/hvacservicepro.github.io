<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
