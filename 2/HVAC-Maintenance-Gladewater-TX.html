<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to find an honest AC man and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
