<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Southbury CT</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the cooling. I proceeded and purchased this Provider and I must state it gets the job done rather well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down the house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
