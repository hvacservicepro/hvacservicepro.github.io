<h3>AC Replacement Service in Pikeville NC 27863</h3>

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
