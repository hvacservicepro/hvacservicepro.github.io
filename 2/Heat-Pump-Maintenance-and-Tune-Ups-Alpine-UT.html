The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
