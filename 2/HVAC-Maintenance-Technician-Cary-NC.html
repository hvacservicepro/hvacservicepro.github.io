<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx clients do not know why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's probably your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to defrost your cooling devices. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
