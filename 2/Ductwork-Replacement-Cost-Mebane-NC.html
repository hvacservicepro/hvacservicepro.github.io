<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
