On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He was friendly, straightforward and a thoroughly satisfying person to have around that whole time. His time and competence to FIX the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>There are a lot of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating unit. Radiant heating systems tend to be much more energy efficient than other heating units, for something. Required air heater tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of up to 30% of their output.

A basic a/c transfers heat energy out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
