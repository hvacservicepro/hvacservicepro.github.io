Incorrectly situated outside air intake vents can also bring in air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
