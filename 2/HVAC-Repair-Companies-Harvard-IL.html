<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
