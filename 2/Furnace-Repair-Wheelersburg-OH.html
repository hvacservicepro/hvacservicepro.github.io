<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>Gas heating systems do include some disadvantages. The biggest drawback is also the result of the combustion procedure. This process produces exhaust gases, consisting of carbon monoxide, which have to be vented to the beyond the house.

Because of this, a malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting problem could put your house's occupants in genuine danger. It is very important to have your gas furnace routinely serviced, and to make certain your house has a carbon monoxide alarm installed.<p>
