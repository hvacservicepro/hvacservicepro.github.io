<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect.

That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
