<p>The function of most structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at affordable energy expenses. Load computing is described as the Manual J calculation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like measuring the size of a system required based on BTUs, identifying the right size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Signs of this might be regular headaches, a burning feeling in nose or eyes, nausea, disorientation, flu-like signs.

<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers impact your comfort, they can also result in duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused spaces is NOT a great idea. You will not conserve any extra money and will wind up triggering more problems for your heating system.<p>
<p>The majority of well and city water does not typically consist of lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the home from home pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
