Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
