<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. When a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>

EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of signs in numerous countless asthmatic children, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year.

For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
