<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
