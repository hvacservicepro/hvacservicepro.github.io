One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist existing, which then generates heat.<p>
