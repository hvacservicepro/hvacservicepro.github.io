<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
