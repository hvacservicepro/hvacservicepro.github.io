<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Sandersville GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
