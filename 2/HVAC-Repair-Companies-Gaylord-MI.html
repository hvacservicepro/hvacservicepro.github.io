<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Gaylord MI</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being much more serious with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
