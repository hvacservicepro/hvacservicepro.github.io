<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
