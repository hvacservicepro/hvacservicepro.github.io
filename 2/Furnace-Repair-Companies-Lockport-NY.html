<p>To safeguard member of the family with asthma or to minimize the possibility that somebody in the home may establish asthma, the home should be checked for possible indoor asthma triggers. Each room in the house has potential asthma triggers. Some issues can be fixed quickly, but others might need more time and work to control or eliminate asthma sets off. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical smells and scents, contribute to indoor air contamination and have been understood to asthma symptoms in delicate people.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
