<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Grand Forks ND?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We picked getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
