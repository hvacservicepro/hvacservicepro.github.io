<h3>Radiant Heating System in Kill Devil Hills NC 27948</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
