<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem.

Poorly situated outdoor air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.
