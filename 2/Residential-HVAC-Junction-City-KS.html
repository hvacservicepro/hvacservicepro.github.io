<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
