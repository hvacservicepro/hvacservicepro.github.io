<p>Last week, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary invasion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a 3rd party supplier.

<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating appliances ought to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

CARB also performs and sponsors research study into all elements of indoor air quality, with a focus on determining levels of exposure to harmful indoor air pollutants, and looking for ways to avoid and minimize that direct exposure.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a high-end product and more like a necessity. (Besides, warmed floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a significant renovation task, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heating system is a suitable solution for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
