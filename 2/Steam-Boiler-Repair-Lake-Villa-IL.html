<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
