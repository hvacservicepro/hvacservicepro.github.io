<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
