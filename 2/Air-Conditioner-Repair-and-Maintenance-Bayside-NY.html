<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
