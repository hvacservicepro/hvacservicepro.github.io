The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to offer and preserve healthy and comfortable environments without impurities. A crucial part of the program is responding to and solving issues of building residents about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
