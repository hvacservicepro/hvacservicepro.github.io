<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer.

The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

Unclean filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in simply a couple of minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
