<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Excelsior Springs MO</h3>
<p>Among the primary reasons a furnace will run constantly is since something is unclean or blocked Before trying to fix any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan".

Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
