<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Poorly situated outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
