<h3>Residential HVAC in Libby MT 59923</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
