<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
