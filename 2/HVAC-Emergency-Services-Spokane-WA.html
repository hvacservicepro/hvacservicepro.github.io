<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
