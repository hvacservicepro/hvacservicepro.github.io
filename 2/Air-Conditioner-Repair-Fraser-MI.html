<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services at Fraser MI</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler usually take place. In many cases, the belt is improperly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
