<p>A main factor in the prevention of health symptoms is an efficient, properly created and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by controlling the quantity of air that is contributed to the workplace environment, the tidiness of such outside air, and the rate at which the office air and its contaminants are either exhausted to the outside or re-circulated throughout the building.<p>
<p>For contaminants other than radon, measurements are most proper when there are either health symptoms or indications of bad ventilation and specific sources or toxins have actually been identified as possible reasons for indoor air quality problems. Checking for many pollutants can be costly.
