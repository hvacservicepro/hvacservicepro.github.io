<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal service. A carefully crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to handle those lulls and peaks so your earnings stay healthy year-round.

<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Mop floorings and clean window ledges and chewable surface areas such as cribs with a service of powdered automatic dishwashing machine cleaning agent in warm water. (Dishwashing machine detergents are suggested due to the fact that of their high content of phosphate.) A lot of multi-purpose cleaners will not remove lead in normal dust.
