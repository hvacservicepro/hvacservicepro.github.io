<p>The purpose of many building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at affordable energy costs. Load determining is described as the Handbook J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling.
