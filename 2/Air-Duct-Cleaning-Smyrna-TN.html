<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by the majority of public water materials, it has been found in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, get in touch with a lab licensed to determine radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon issues in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and reliable  approach to reduce ambient air pollution and prospective health threats, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by providing a professional quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Occupants of homes with bad indoor air quality may experience symptoms such as headache, eye inflammation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus queasiness, dizziness, and congestion. Due to the fact that many illnesses can cause these symptoms, detecting ill building syndrome is difficult. Extremely high levels of some impurities, such as carbon monoxide gas, can cause more severe disease, including death.<p>
