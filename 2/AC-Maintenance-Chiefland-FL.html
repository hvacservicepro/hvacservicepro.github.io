<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
