<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Sun Valley NV</h3>
<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
