<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heat pump technologies are readily available to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Support! Environment Pro is trusted and truly cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could search for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated house again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Although installation is simple and doesn't need much time, trying this task is not an excellent idea. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, taking on the installation could trigger damage or installation mistakes that lead to higher utility expenses and poor system efficiency. In addition, HVAC systems have service warranties that require qualified service technicians to carry out installation. You might void the warranties by handling that task.<p>
<p>If you have a large home, a home with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floors instead of the air may not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. House owners would be well encouraged to perform a home energy audit to evaluate where improvements might be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These modifications might in fact accumulate and perhaps lower your perceived need for in-floor heating.<p>
