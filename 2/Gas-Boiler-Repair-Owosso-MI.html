<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, examining and replacing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a few minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>A customized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
