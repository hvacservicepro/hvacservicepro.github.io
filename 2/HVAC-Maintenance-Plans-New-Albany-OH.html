<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
