<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
