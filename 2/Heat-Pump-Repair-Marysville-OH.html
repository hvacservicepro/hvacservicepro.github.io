<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
