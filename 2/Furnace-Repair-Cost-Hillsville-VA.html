<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
