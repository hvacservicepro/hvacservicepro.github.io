Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
