<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
