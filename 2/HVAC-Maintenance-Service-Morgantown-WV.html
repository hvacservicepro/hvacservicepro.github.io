<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
