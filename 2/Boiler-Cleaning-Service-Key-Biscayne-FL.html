The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
