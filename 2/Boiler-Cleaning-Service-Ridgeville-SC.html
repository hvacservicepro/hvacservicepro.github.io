<p>New furnaces are considerably more efficient than those of 10 or more years ago, cutting costs by as much as 30%. To get repair-free and lasting performance from your new system, proper installation is a necessity. Brian and Sons Inc has the years of experience and hands-on item familiarity to address any difficulties your home pay present. Our NATE-certified service technicians will correctly fit your equipment to match your size requirements, installation area, and ductwork. Your current furnace may not be the perfect size to suit your requirements. The majority of older heater are far larger than needed.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
