<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
