<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
