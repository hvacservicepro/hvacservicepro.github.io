<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
