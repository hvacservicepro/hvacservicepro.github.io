<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air going however also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very expert, considerate and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and fixed extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They utilize a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs needed to heat the space. The bigger the space, the more powerful the house heater requires to be. For currently constructed house heating unit, the contractor will require to remove the old furnace to add the brand-new one. These charges will be consisted of in the installation expenses.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company.
