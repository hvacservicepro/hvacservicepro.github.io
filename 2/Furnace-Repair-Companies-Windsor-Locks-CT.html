<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at sensible energy costs. Load computing is described as the Manual J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video alone. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, identifying the correct size of unit for your house also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
