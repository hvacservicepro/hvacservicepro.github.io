<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
