The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
