<h3>Picking the Right Business For Heating and AC Systems at Northampton MA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
