<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves inspecting the suggested connections in addition to temperature level and pressure gauges.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
