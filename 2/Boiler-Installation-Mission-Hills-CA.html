<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.
