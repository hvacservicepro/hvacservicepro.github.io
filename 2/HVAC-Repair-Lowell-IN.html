<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is designed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality.

<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, during new building (houses typically use in between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are decreasing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
