<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
