<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
