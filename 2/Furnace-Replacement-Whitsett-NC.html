Environment Pro is trustworthy and really appreciated us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
