<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
