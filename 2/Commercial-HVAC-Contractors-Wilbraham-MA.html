Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils.

It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
