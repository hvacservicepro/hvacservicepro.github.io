<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
