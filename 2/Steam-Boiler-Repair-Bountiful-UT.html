<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
