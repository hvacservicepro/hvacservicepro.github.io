<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the ac system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
