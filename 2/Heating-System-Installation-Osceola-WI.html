<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
