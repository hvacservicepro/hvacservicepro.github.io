<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was sort of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
