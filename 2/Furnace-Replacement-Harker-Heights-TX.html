<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

In the summer season, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature level stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide constant and reliable cooling and heating.<p>
