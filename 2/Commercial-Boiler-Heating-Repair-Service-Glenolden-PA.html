"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
