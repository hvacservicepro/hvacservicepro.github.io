<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider.
