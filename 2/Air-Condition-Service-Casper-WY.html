The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the main issue in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has actually carried out.

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
