<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in Roosevelt</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Pressed wood products produced indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.
