And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
