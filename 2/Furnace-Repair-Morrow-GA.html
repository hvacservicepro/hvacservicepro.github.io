<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Before cooling or installing any brand-new heating system in a house, it is necessary to re reduce the energy and assess load of the house. A more energy effective home will not only decrease the cost of a brand-new system and utility expenses, however it will considerably improve the convenience of your house. Before we style and set up any systems, we schedule a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements normally consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can suggest several certified house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
