<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor impurities exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
