<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
