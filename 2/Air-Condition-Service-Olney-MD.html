<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same.

Since they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
