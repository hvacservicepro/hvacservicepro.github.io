The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed occasionally to eliminate tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water areas).

<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials contribute to bad air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
