<p>Certain instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically difficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to take note of the time and place the signs occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
