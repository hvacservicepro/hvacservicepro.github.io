<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Putnam CT</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
