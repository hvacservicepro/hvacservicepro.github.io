<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
