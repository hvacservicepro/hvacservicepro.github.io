<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's instructions, specifically guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
