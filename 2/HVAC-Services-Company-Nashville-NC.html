<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
