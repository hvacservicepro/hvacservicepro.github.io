<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it since it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater air flow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air filtration innovations are ending up being more common as offered options in residential and commercial HVAC item packages. Adoption of these innovations, however, has not been prevalent, as consumers remain mostly oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
