<p>The answer to the question, What does an HVAC technician do?, will vary somewhat depending on industry of specialty, employment, and position. What does not differ is the importance of the work that these professionals do. Heating and air conditioning systems manage the temperature level, humidity, and overall air quality in homes, office buildings, schools, healthcare facilities, factories, stores, and other centers.

<p>Because they eliminate moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
