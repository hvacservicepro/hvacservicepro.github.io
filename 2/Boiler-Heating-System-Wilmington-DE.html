As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan.
