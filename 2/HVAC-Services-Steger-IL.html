<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Steger IL</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My other half said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually satisfied in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
