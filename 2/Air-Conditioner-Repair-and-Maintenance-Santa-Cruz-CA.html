<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses suddenly appear greater than regular, it is most likely time to consider a new system.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
