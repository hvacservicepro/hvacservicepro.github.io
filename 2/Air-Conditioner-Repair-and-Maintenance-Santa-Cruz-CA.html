<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
