<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Covington VA?</h3>
<p>Most people are aware that outside air contamination can impact their health, but indoor air pollution can also have considerable, damaging impact. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air toxins indicate that indoor levels of pollutants might be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top 5 environmental health risks to the public.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace frequently. Change the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned up due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, reducing their effectiveness in time. Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
