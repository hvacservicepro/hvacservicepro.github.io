If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief cycling in really cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will merely run more difficult to maintain a warm environment for your home when the weather condition is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you require clarity on this issue, contact one of our professionals.<p>

But more complicated problems-- identified by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the three techniques listed below might be proper.<p>
