<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

<p>Heaters are like vehicles. As they age, you can change one part just require another part changed or fixed next year. It doesn't take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts.

<p>Just like many home improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ extensively based upon the size of the home. A lot of heating systems will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners ought to consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
