<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at La Junta CO</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
