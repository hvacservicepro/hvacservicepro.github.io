<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair.
