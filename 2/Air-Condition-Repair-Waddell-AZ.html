<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system.

When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
