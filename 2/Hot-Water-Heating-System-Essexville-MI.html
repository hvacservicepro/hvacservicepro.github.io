<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
