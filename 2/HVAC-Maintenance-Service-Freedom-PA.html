<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be named since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy intake and temperatures in stores to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the stores vary outside of an appropriate variety that could prevent clients from shopping at the store.<p>
