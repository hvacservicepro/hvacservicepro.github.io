<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
