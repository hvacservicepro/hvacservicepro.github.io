<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
