Rather of pushing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and floor, ductless systems circulate air directly to specific spaces.

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
