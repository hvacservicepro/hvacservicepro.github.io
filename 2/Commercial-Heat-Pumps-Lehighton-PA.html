<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Lehighton PA 18235</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leakage in the attic.
