<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
