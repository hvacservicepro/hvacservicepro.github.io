<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting info on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<p>My oldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
