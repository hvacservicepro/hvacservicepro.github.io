<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
