<p>Outdoor impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Specialists suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Utilize professionals and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated specialists carry out much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
