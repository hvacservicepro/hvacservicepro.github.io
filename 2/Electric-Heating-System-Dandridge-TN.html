<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
