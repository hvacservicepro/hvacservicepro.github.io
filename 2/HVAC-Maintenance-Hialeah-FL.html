<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
