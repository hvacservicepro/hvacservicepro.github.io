<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold might be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system.

Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.
