<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
