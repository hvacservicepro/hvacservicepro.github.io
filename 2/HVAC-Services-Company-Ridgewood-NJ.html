<p>Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be successfully determined or fixed without a thorough building investigation.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
