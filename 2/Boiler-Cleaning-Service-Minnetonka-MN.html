Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release contaminants more or less continually.

The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
