<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
