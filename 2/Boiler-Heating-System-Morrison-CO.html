<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, however many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution.
