Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is currently widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
