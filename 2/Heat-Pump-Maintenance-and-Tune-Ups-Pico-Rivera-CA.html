<p>When setting up radiant heat, you ought to provide serious thought to the kind of floor covering in the house. Since it conducts and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less effective, but work fairly well. Carpeting will directly insulate the flooring from the room, decreasing effectiveness, so if you wish to set up carpet in a radiant-heated space, utilize a thin carpet with thick padding.<p>
<p>A/c can create a lot of water due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>
