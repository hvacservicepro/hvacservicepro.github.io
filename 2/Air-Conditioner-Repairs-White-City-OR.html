<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really handy in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
