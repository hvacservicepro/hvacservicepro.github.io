So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses.

Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, dependable, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
