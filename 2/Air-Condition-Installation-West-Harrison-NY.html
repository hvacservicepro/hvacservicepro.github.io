<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
