<p>To establish a safe assessment or consultation with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing specialists in your location in an online search. Message or call technicians to ask whether they can carry out a consultation over the phone and even over a video call.

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites should find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the truth of a vicious, harsh summertime.<p>
