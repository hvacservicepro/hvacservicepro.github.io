<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.
