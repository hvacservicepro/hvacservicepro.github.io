<p>As kept in mind, inappropriate temperature and humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation may also add to worker health grievances. Temperature level levels should vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation must be prevented. Maintenance of appropriate temperatures and humidity levels and appropriate air blood circulation will help to reduce the occurrence of upper breathing signs, and, perhaps, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on.

Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
