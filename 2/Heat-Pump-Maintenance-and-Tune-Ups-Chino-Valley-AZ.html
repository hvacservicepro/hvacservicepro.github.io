Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
