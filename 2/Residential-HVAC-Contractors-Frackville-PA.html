<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
