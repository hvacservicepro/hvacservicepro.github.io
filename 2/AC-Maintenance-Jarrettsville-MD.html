<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Jarrettsville MD</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological contaminants are moist or wet building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
