<h3>Ductless AC System in Franklin PA 16323</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, professional and extremely well done. The installers were courteous and knew precisely what to do.

I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on detail that develops a job very well done. I really extremely advise the 2 gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
