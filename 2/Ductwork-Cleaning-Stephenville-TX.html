What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
