<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
