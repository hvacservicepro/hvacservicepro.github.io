These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
