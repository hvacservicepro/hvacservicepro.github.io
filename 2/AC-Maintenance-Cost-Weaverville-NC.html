<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
