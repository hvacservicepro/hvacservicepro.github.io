<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Wisconsin Dells WI</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors.

And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
