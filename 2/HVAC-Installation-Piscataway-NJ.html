<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance.

<p>In 2011, NASA watched for an air conditioning system to set up in their lunar electric rover. They decided they needed expert assistance and sought advice from numerous suppliers.
