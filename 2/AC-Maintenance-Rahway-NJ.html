<p>Typically the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs.

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is often important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information might recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are really low, monitoring information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
