<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested.

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the component.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
