<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outside settings.

The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
