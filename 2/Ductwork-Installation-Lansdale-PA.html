<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
