<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
