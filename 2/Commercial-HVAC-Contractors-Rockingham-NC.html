<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Kids might have greater exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
