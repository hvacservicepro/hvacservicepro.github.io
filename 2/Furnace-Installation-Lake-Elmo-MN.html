<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
