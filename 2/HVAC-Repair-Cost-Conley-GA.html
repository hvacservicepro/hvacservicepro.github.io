<p>These people have been great. At a realtor, I often require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house might cost. Recently I needed to call on these guys two times. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a company model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
