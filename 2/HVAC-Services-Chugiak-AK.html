<p>Radiant heating involves installing coils or pipelines in the floor, providing heat from listed below and moving upward. It provides an even, total heat temperature level throughout the space. With no moving parts, it's really peaceful and comfy, and it does not stimulate as much dust and irritants, as compared to forced-air systems.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works however the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
