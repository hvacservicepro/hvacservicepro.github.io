<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, missing or malfunctioning wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves checking the recommended connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are safe and tight.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators utilized harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>You could upgrade to the highest efficiency equipment readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air gets away the system.<p>
