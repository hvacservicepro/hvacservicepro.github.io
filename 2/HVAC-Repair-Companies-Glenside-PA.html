<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

We would extremely motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
