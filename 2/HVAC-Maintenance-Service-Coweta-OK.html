<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical power and gas increasing, it is very important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.

Rather, the combustion is optimized by measuring the exhaust gasses and making clinical changes. This alone might pay for the whole maintenance check out at today's rate of natural gas.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
