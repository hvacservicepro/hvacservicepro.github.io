<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Due to the fact that they only partly remove the radon decay products and do not diminish the quantity of radon getting in the house, the efficiency of these gadgets is uncertain.

<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as a very effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
