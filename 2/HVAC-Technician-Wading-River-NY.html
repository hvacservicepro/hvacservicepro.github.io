<p>The installation was quick, professional and effectively done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do.

<p>To start, it's an excellent concept to consider energy effectiveness. By picking a central AC system that has as high of an efficiency score as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save money in the long run. Performance ratings need to be labeled with all units. While effective units may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated appliance is a great way to enjoy additional peace of mind.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality issue is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complicated concerns-- identified by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics listed below might be appropriate.<p>
