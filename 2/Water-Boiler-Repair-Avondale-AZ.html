<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer contracts.  The so called reliable companies rip off more people than the fly by night outfits. I know since I attempted to work for them. I stop because 90% of them are crooks. They walk in with or without a contract and start offering you things you do not need. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a specialist to verify the so called treatments and issues. 9 out of 10, I examine are entirely wrong.<p>

In addition, inspection and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to specifications for developing usage and occupancy) should be performed. A structure walk-through to check for smells and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be useful. Leaks require to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with germs or fungi and need to be removed, also.
