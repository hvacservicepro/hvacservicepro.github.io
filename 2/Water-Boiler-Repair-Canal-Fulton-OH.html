<p>Your concerns or concerns about indoor air issues can frequently be addressed by the federal government agencies in your state or local government. Responsibilities for indoor air quality problems are generally divided amongst several companies. Calling or composing the firms accountable for health or air quality control is the best way to start getting information from your state or local government. To get state firm contacts, call or write EPA's IAQ Information Clearinghouse, (800) 438-4318, (703) 356-4020 in the Washington, D.C. area.<p>
<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
