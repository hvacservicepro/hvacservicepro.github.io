<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
