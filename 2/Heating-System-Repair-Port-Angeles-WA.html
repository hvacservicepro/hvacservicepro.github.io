<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Port Angeles WA</h3>
<p>Medical facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to minimize infection risk and the humidity controlled to restrict client dehydration. Although temperature levels are often in the comfort variety, some specialist treatments, such as open heart surgical treatment, require low temperatures (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and process applications, the objective may be to not only manage temperature level, but also humidity, air quality, and air motion from space to space.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
