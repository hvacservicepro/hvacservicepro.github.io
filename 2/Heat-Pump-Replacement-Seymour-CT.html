The contracting side of business continued under numerous owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>

<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
