<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
