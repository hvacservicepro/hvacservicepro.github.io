<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping device to circulate hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat transferred heat to other short articles in the rooms, consisting of the human occupants.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being caught in concentrations and structures develop up indoors.<p>

<p>Many individuals ignore the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is generally visualized as the black smoke given off from factories. Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the home. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and over half that time is spent in the home.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil change in your car. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

These elements consist of bad ventilation (lack of outdoors air), issues managing temperature level, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air coming into the structure.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
