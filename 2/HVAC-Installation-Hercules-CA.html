Roughly a quarter of all service calls might be prevented with easy furnace repairs that cost little or absolutely nothing. In this article, we'll focus on the typical furnace troubleshooting offenders and show you what to do about furnace problems.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas heaters While oil is generally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option in between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house.
