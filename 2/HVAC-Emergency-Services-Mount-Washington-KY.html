Or if the outside air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor pollutant, it might function as a pathway to carry the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working as well as it must-- if debris is blocking the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or poorly preserved.<p>
<h3>Central Heat And Air Units in Mount Washington Kentucky</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint materials, and car emissions in connected garages. Actions that will reduce benzene exposure include eliminating smoking cigarettes within the home, attending to optimum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint products and special fuels that will not be utilized immediately.<p>

That is why it is so important to call a company you can rely and rely on on-- Jennings Cooling And Heating.<p>
