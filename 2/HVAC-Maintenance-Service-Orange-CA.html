For this reason, it is necessary to pay attention to the time and location symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the location, for example, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outdoor air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent inside your home.<p>

Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
