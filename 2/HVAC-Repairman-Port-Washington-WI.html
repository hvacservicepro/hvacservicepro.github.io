<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance in Port Washington Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly.
