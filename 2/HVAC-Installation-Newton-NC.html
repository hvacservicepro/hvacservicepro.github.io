<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which differs enormously from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system producers typically make rugged, high quality items. Start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>

<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin resulting from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burned off. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In bathrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>The primary health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
